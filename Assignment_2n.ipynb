supposed _to be on the stage_, facing the audience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npreface.\\n\\n\\nthe play of _hamlet_ is above all others the most stupendous monument\\nof shakespeare\\'s genius, standing as a beacon to command the wonder\\nand admiration of the world, and as a memorial to future generations,\\nthat the mind of its author was moved by little less than inspiration.\\n_lear_, with its sublime picture of human misery;--_othello_, with its\\nharrowing overthrow of a nature great and amiable;--_macbeth_, with\\nits fearful murder of a monarch, whose \"virtues plead like angels\\ntrumpet-tongued against the deep damnation of his taking\\noff,\"--severally exhibit, in the most pre-eminent degree, all those\\nmighty elements which constitute the perfection of tragic art--the\\ngrand, the pitiful, and the terrible. _hamlet_ is a history of mind--a\\ntragedy of thought. it contains the deepest philosophy, and most\\nprofound wisdom; yet speaks the language of the heart, touching the\\nsecret spring of every sense and feeling. here we have no ideal\\nexaltation of character, but life with its blended faults and\\nvirtues,--a gentle nature unstrung by passing events, and thus\\nrendered \"out of tune and harsh.\"\\n\\nthe original story of hamlet is to be found in the latin pages of the\\ndanish historian, saxo grammaticus, who died in the year 1208.\\ntowards the end of the sixteenth century, the french author, francis\\nde belleforest, introduced the fable into a collection of novels,\\nwhich were translated into english, and printed in a small quarto\\nblack letter volume, under the title of the \"historie of hamblett,\"\\nfrom which source shakespeare constructed the present tragedy.\\n\\nsaxo has placed his history about 200 years before christianity, when\\nbarbarians, clothed in skins, peopled the shores of the baltic. the\\npoet, however, has so far modernised the subject as to make hamlet a\\nchristian, and england tributary to the \"sovereign majesty of\\ndenmark.\" a date can therefore be easily fixed, and the costume of\\nthe tenth and eleventh centuries may be selected for the purpose.\\nthere are but few authentic records in existence, but these few\\nafford reason to believe that very slight difference existed between\\nthe dress of the dane and that of the anglo-saxon of the same period.\\n\\nsince its first representation, upwards of two centuries and a half\\nago, no play has been acted so frequently, or commanded such\\nuniversal admiration. it draws within the sphere of its attraction\\nboth the scholastic and the unlearned. it finds a response in every\\nbreast, however high or however humble. by its colossal aid it exalts\\nthe drama of england above that of every nation, past or present. it\\nis, indeed, the most marvellous creation of human intellect.\\n\\ncharles kean.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhamlet,\\n\\nprince of denmark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nact i.\\n\\nscene i.--elsinore. a platform

later folios, probably came from shakespeare’s\\npen. similar cases occur frequently, especially when the verb precedes\\nits nominative. for example, _tempest_, iv. 1. 262, ‘lies at my mercy\\nall mine enemies,’ and _measure for measure_, ii. 1. 22, ‘what knows the\\nlaws, &c.’ we correct it in those passages where the occurrence of a\\nvulgarism would be likely to annoy the reader. in the mouth of a\\nboatswain it can offend no one. we therefore leave it.\\n\\n\\nnote ii.\\n\\ni. 1. 57-59. _mercy on us!--we split, &c._ it may be doubtful whether\\nthe printer of the first folio intended these broken speeches to express\\n‘a confused noise within.’ without question such was the author’s\\nmeaning. rowe, however, and subsequent editors, printed them as part of\\ngonzalo’s speech. capell was the first editor who gave the true\\narrangement.\\n\\n\\nnote iii.\\n\\ni. 2. 173. _princesses._ see mr sidney walker’s _shakespeare’s\\nversification_, p. 243 sqq. ’the plurals of substantives ending in _s_,\\nin certain instances, in _se_, _ss_, _ce_, and sometimes _ge_, ... are\\nfound without the usual addition of _s_ or _es_, in pronunciation at\\nleast, although in many instances the plural affix is added in printing,\\nwhere the metre shows that it is not to be pronounced.’\\n\\nin this and other instances, we have thought it better to trust to the\\near of the reader for the rhythm than to introduce an innovation in\\northography which might perplex him as to the sense. the form\\n‘princesses,’ the use of which in shakespeare’s time was doubted by one\\nof our correspondents, is found in the _history of king leir_.\\n\\nrowe’s reading ‘princes’ might be defended on the ground that the\\nsentiment is general, and applicable to royal children of both sexes; or\\nthat sir philip sidney, in the first book of the _arcadia_, calls pamela\\nand philoclea ‘princes.’\\n\\n\\nnote iv.\\n\\ni. 2. 298. the metre of this line, as well as of lines 301, 302, is\\ndefective, but as no mode of correction can be regarded as completely\\nsatisfactory we have in accordance with our custom left the lines as\\nthey are printed in the folio. the defect, indeed, in the metre of line\\n298 has not been noticed except by hanmer, who makes a line thus:\\n\\n  ‘do so, and after two days i’ll discharge thee.’\\n\\npossibly it ought to be printed thus:\\n\\n              ‘do so; and\\n  after two days\\n  i will discharge thee.’\\n\\nthere is a broken line, also of four syllables, 253 of the same scene,\\nanother of seven, 235.\\n\\nthere is no reason to doubt that the _words_ are as shakespeare wrote\\nthem, for, although the action of the play terminates in less than four\\nhours (i. 2. 240 and v. 1. 186), yet ariel’s ministry is not to end till\\nthe voyage to naples shall be over. prospero, too, repeats his promise,\\nand marks his contentment by further shortening the time of servitude,\\n‘within two days,’ i. 2. 420. possibly ‘invisible’ (301) should have a\\nline to itself. words thus occupying a broken line acquire a marked\\nemphasis.\\n\\nbut the truth is that in dialogue shakespeare’s language passes so\\nrapidly from verse to prose and from prose to verse, sometimes even\\nhovering, as it were, over the confines, being rhythmical rather than\\nmetrical, that all attempts to give regularity to the metre must be made\\nwith diffidence and received with doubt.\\n\\n\\nnote v.\\n\\ni. 2. 377, 378:\\n\\n  _courtsied when you have and kiss’d_\\n  _the wild waves whist._\\n\\nthis punctuation seems to be supported by what ferdinand says (391,\\n392):\\n\\n  ‘the music crept by me upon the waters,\\n  allaying both their fury and my passion, &c.’\\n\\nat the end of the stanza we have printed _hark, hark! ... the watch-dogs\\nbark_ as that part of the burthen which ‘sweet sprites bear.’ the other\\npart is borne by distant watch-dogs.\\n\\n\\nnote vi.\\n\\ni. 2. 443. _i fear you have done yourself some wrong._ see this phrase\\nused in a similar sense, _measure for measure_, i. 11. 39.\\n\\n\\nnote vii.\\n\\nii. 1. 27. _which, of he or adrian._ ‘of’ is found in the same\\nconstruction, _midsummer night’s dream_, iii. 2. 336,\\n\\n  ‘now follow if thou darest to try whose right,\\n  of thine or mine, is most in helena.’\\n\\n\\nnote viii.\\n\\nii. 1. 157. _of its own kind._ there is no doubt, as dr guest has shewn,\\nthat ‘it,’ which is the reading of the 1st and 2nd folios, was commonly\\nused as a genitive in shakespeare’s time, as it is still in some\\nprovincial dialects. ‘its,’ however, was coming into use. one instance\\noccurs in this play, i. 11. 95, ‘in its contrary.’\\n\\n\\nnote ix.\\n\\nii. 1. 241. _she that from whom._ mr spedding writes: ‘the received\\nemendation is not satisfactory to me. i would rather read, “she\\nthat--from whom? all were sea-swallow’d &c., i.e. from whom should she\\nhave note? the report from naples will be that all were drowned. we\\nshall be the only survivors.” the break in the construction seems to me\\ncharacteristic of the speaker. but you must read the whole speech to\\nfeel the effect.’\\n\\n\\nnote x.\\n\\nii. 1. 249-251. all editors except mr staunton have printed in italics\\n(or between inverted commas) only as far as ‘_naples?_’, but as ‘_keep_’\\nis printed with a small k in the folios, they seem to sanction the\\narrangement given in our text.\\n\\n\\nnote xi.\\n\\nii. 1. 267. _ay, sir; where lies that? if ’twere a kibe._ mr singer and\\nmr dyce have changed ‘’twere’ to ‘it were’ for the sake of the metre.\\nbut then the first part of the line must be read with a wrong emphasis.\\nthe proper emphasis clearly falls on the first, third, and fifth\\nsyllables, ‘aý, sir; whére lies thát?’ see preface.\\n\\n\\nnote xii.\\n\\nii. 2. 165. before ‘here; bear my bottle’ capell inserts a stage\\ndirection [_to cal._], but it appears from iii. 2. 62, that trinculo was\\nentrusted with the office of bottle-bearer.\\n\\n\\nnote xiii.\\n\\niii. 1. 15. _most busy lest, when i do it._ as none of the proposed\\nemendations can be regarded as certain, we have left the reading of f1,\\nthough it is manifestly corrupt. the spelling ‘doe’ makes mr spedding’s\\nconjecture ‘idlest’ for ‘i doe it’ more probable.\\n\\n\\nnote xiv.\\n\\niii. 3. 17. the stage direction, which we have divided into two parts,\\nis placed all at once in the folios after ‘as when they are fresh’\\n[solemne and strange musicke; and prosper on the top (invisible:) enter\\n... depart].\\n\\npope transferred it to follow sebastian’s words, ‘i say, to night: no\\nmore.’\\n\\n\\nnote xv.\\n\\niii. 3. 48. _each putter out of five for one._ see beaumont and\\nfletcher, _the noble gentleman_, i. 1. (vol. ii. p. 261, ed. moxon):\\n‘the return will give you five for one.’ marine is about to travel.\\n\\n\\nnote xvi.\\n\\niv. 1. 146. _you do look, my son, in a moved sort._ seymour suggests a\\ntransposition: ‘you do, my son, look in a moved sort.’ this line however\\ncan scarcely have come from shakespeare’s pen. perhaps the writer who\\ncomposed the masque was allowed to join it, as best he might, to\\nshakespeare’s words, which re-commence at ‘our revels now are ended,’\\n&c.\\n\\n\\nnote xvii.\\n\\niv. 1. 230. _let’s alone._ see staunton’s “shakespeare,” vol. i. p. 81,\\nnote (b).\\n\\n\\nnote xviii.\\n\\nv. 1. 309. _of these our dear-beloved solemnized._ the folios have\\n‘belov’d’; a mode of spelling, which in this case is convenient as\\nindicating the probable rhythm of the verse. we have written ‘beloved,’\\nin accordance with the general rule mentioned in the preface.\\n\\n‘solemnized’ occurs in four other verse passages of shakespeare. it is\\nthree times to be accented ‘sólemnized’ and once (_love’s labour’s\\nlost_, ii. 1. 41) ‘solémnized.’\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n           *       *       *       *\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nsources:\\n\\nthe editors’ preface (e-text 23041) discusses the 17th- and\\n18th-century editions in detail; the newer (19th-century) editions\\nare simply listed by name. the following editions may appear in the\\nnotes. all inset text is quoted from the preface.\\n\\n  folios:\\n  f1 1623; f2 (no date given); f3 1663; f4 1685.\\n    “the five plays contained in this volume occur in the first folio\\n    in the same order, and ... were there printed for the first time.”\\n\\n  early editions:\\n  rowe 1709\\n  pope 1715\\n    “pope was the first to indicate the _place_ of each new scene;\\n    as, for instance, _tempest_, i. 1. ‘on a ship at sea.’ he also\\n    subdivided the scenes as given by the folios and rowe, making\\n    a fresh scene whenever a new character entered--an arrangement\\n    followed by hanmer, warburton, and johnson. for convenience of\\n    reference to these editions, we have always recorded the\\n    commencement of pope’s scenes.”\\n  theobald 1733\\n  hanmer (“oxford edition”) 1744\\n  warburton 1747\\n  johnson 1765\\n  capell 1768; _also capell’s annotated copy of f2_\\n  steevens 1773\\n  malone 1790\\n  reed 1803\\n\\n  later editions:\\n  singer, knight, cornwall, collier, phelps, halliwell, dyce, staunton\\n\\n  dryden:\\n    “_the tempest_ was altered by dryden and d’avenant, and published\\n    as _the tempest; or the enchanted island_, in 1669. we mark the\\n    emendations derived from it: ‘dryden’s version.’”\\n\\n\\nerrors and inconsistencies:\\n\\n  _re-enter boatswain._\\n    [printed boatswain in small capitals]\\n  _enter _ariel_._\\n    [printed “ariel” in lower case]\\n  where my son lies. when did you lose you daughter?\\n    [text unchanged: error for “your”?]\\n\\n  [text-critical notes]\\n\\n  i. 2. 135: _to ’t_] om. steevens (farmer conj.).\\n    [here and elsewhere in the volume, body text has unspaced “to’t”\\n    while line notes have spaced “to ’t”.]\\n  i. 2. 202: _o’ the_] _of_ pope.\\n    [text unchanged: body text is capitalized “o’ the”]\\n  ii. 1. 88: _ay._] i. ff. _ay?_ pope.\\n    [text unchanged: apparent error for italic _i._]\\n  iii. 3. 17: prospero above]\\n    [text unchanged: stage direction is after l. 19]\\n\\n  [endnotes]\\n\\n  i: i. 1. 15.

from his works may be\\n     collected a system of civil and economical prudence.  he has\\n     been imitated by all succeeding writers; and it may be\\n     doubted whether from all his successors more maxims of\\n     theoretical knowledge, or more rules of practical prudence\\n     can be collected than he alone has given to his country.”--\\n     dr. samuel johnson.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npreface\\n\\n\\n\\nthe writings of shakespeare have been justly termed “the richest, the\\npurest, the fairest, that genius uninspired ever penned.”\\n\\nshakespeare instructed by delighting. his plays alone (leaving mere\\nscience out of the question), contain more actual wisdom than the\\nwhole body of english learning. he is the teacher of all good-- pity,\\ngenerosity, true courage, love. his bright wit is cut out “into little\\nstars.” his solid masses of knowledge are meted out in morsels and\\nproverbs, and thus distributed, there is scarcely a corner of the\\nenglish-speaking world to-day which he does not illuminate, or a cottage\\nwhich he does not enrich. his bounty is like the sea, which, though\\noften unacknowledged, is everywhere felt. as his friend, ben jonson,\\nwrote of him, “he was not of an age but for all time.” he ever kept the\\nhighroad of human life whereon all travel. he did not pick out by-paths\\nof feeling and sentiment. in his creations we have no moral highwaymen,\\nsentimental thieves, interesting villains, and amiable, elegant\\nadventuresses--no delicate entanglements of situation, in which\\nthe grossest images are presented to the mind disguised under the\\nsuperficial attraction of style and sentiment. he flattered no bad\\npassion, disguised no vice in the garb of virtue, trifled with no just\\nand generous principle. while causing us to laugh at folly, and shudder\\nat crime, he still preserves our love for our fellow-beings, and our\\nreverence for ourselves.\\n\\nshakespeare was familiar with all beautiful forms and images, with\\nall that is sweet or majestic in the simple aspects of nature, of\\nthat indestructible love of flowers and fragrance, and dews, and\\nclear waters--and soft airs and sounds, and bright skies and woodland\\nsolitudes, and moon-light bowers, which are the material elements of\\npoetry,--and with that fine sense of their indefinable relation to\\nmental emotion, which is its essence and vivifying soul--and which, in\\nthe midst of his most busy and tragical scenes, falls like gleams of\\nsunshine on rocks and ruins--contrasting with all that is rugged or\\nrepulsive, and reminding us of the existence of purer and brighter\\nelements.\\n\\nthese things considered, what wonder is it that the works of\\nshakespeare, next to the bible, are the most highly esteemed of all the\\nclassics of english literature. “so extensively have the characters of\\nshakespeare been drawn upon by artists, poets, and writers of fiction,”\\n says an american author,--“so interwoven are these characters in the\\ngreat body of english literature, that to be ignorant of the plot of\\nthese dramas is often a cause of embarrassment.”\\n\\nbut shakespeare wrote for grown-up people, for men and women, and in\\nwords that little folks cannot understand.\\n\\nhence this volume. to reproduce the entertaining stories contained\\nin the plays of shakespeare, in a form so simple that children can\\nunderstand and enjoy them, was the object had in view by the author of\\nthese beautiful stories from shakespeare.\\n\\nand that the youngest readers may not stumble in pronouncing any\\nunfamiliar names to be met with in the stories, the editor has prepared\\nand included in the volume a pronouncing vocabulary of difficult names.\\nto which is added a collection of shakespearean quotations, classified\\nin alphabetical order, illustrative of the wisdom and genius of the\\nworld\\'s greatest dramatist.\\n\\ne. t. r.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na brief life of shakespeare.\\n\\n\\n\\nin the register of baptisms of the parish church of stratford-upon-avon,\\na market town in warwickshire, england, appears, under date of april 26,\\n1564, the entry of the baptism of william, the son of john shakspeare.\\nthe entry is in latin--“gulielmus filius johannis shakspeare.”\\n\\nthe date of william shakespeare\\'s birth has usually been taken as three\\ndays before his baptism, but there is certainly no evidence of this\\nfact.\\n\\nthe family name was variously spelled, the dramatist himself not always\\nspelling it in the same way. while in the baptismal record the name is\\nspelled “shakspeare,” in several authentic autographs of the dramatist\\nit reads “shakspere,” and in the first edition of his works it is\\nprinted “shakespeare.”\\n\\nhalliwell tells us, that there are not less than thirty-four ways in\\nwhich the various members of the shakespeare family wrote the name,\\nand in the council-book of the corporation of stratford, where it is\\nintroduced one hundred and sixty-six times during the period that\\nthe dramatist\\'s father was a member of the municipal body, there are\\nfourteen different spellings. the modern “shakespeare” is not among\\nthem.\\n\\nshakespeare\\'s father, while an alderman at stratford, appears to have\\nbeen unable to write his name, but as at that time nine men out of\\nten were content to make their mark for a signature, the fact is not\\nspecially to his discredit.\\n\\nthe traditions and other sources of information about the occupation\\nof shakespeare\\'s father differ. he is described as a butcher, a\\nwoolstapler, and a glover, and it is not impossible that he may have\\nbeen all of these simultaneously or at different times, or that if\\nhe could not properly be called any one of them, the nature of his\\noccupation was such as to make it easy to understand how the various\\ntraditions sprang up. he was a landed proprietor and cultivator of his\\nown land even before his marriage, and he received with his wife, who\\nwas mary arden, daughter of a country gentleman, the estate of asbies,\\n56 acres in extent. william was the third child. the two older than he\\nwere daughters, and both probably died in infancy. after him was born\\nthree sons and a daughter. for ten or twelve years at least, after\\nshakespeare\\'s birth his father continued to be in easy circumstances. in\\nthe year 1568 he was the high bailiff or chief magistrate of stratford,\\nand for many years afterwards he held the position of alderman as he\\nhad done for three years before. to the completion of his tenth year,\\ntherefore, it is natural to suppose that william shakespeare would get\\nthe best education that stratford could afford. the free school of the\\ntown was open to all boys and like all the grammar-schools of that time,\\nwas under the direction of men who, as graduates of the universities,\\nwere qualified to diffuse that sound scholarship which was once the\\nboast of england. there is no record of shakespeare\\'s having been at\\nthis school, but there can be no rational doubt that he was educated\\nthere. his father could not have procured for him a better education\\nanywhere. to those who have studied shakespeare\\'s works without being\\ninfluenced by the old traditional theory that he had received a very\\nnarrow education, they abound with evidences that he must have been\\nsolidly grounded in the learning, properly so called, was taught in the\\ngrammar schools.\\n\\nthere are local associations connected with stratford which could not\\nbe without their influence in the formation of young shakespeare\\'s mind.\\nwithin the range of such a boy\\'s curiosity were the fine old historic\\ntowns of warwick and coventry, the sumptuous palace of kenilworth, the\\ngrand monastic remains of evesham. his own avon abounded with spots of\\nsingular beauty, quiet hamlets, solitary woods. nor was stratford shut\\nout from the general world, as many country towns are. it was a great\\nhighway, and dealers with every variety of merchandise resorted to its\\nmarkets. the eyes of the poet dramatist must always have been open for\\nobservation. but nothing is known positively of shakespeare from his\\nbirth to his marriage to anne hathaway in 1582, and from that date\\nnothing but the birth of three children until we find him an actor in\\nlondon about 1589.\\n\\nhow long acting continued to be shakespeare\\'s sole profession we have\\nno means of knowing, but it is in the highest degree probable that very\\nsoon after arriving in london he began that work of adaptation by which\\nhe is known to have begun his literary career. to improve and alter\\nolder plays not up to the standard that was required at the time was\\na common practice even among the best dramatists of the day, and\\nshakespeare\\'s abilities would speedily mark him out as eminently fitted\\nfor this kind of work. when the alterations in plays originally composed\\nby other writers became very extensive, the work of adaptation would\\nbecome in reality a work of creation. and this is exactly what we have\\nexamples of in a few of shakespeare\\'s early works, which are known to\\nhave been founded on older plays.\\n\\nit is unnecessary here to extol the published works of the world\\'s\\ngreatest dramatist. criticism has been exhausted upon them, and the\\nfinest minds of england, germany, and america have devoted their powers\\nto an elucidation of their worth.\\n\\nshakespeare died at stratford on the 23rd of april, 1616. his father had\\ndied before him, in 1602, and his mother in 1608. his wife survived\\nhim till august, 1623. his so hamnet died in 1596 at the age of eleven\\nyears. his two daughters survived him, the eldest of whom, susanna, had,\\nin 1607, married a physician of stratford, dr. hall. the only issue of\\nthis marriage, a daughter named elizabeth, born in 1608, married first\\nthomas nasbe, and afterwards sir john barnard, but left no children by\\neither marriage. shakespeare\\'s younger daughter, judith, on the 10th of\\nfebruary, 1616, married a stratford gentleman named thomas quincy, by\\nwhom she had three sons, all of whom died, however, without issue. there\\nare thus no direct descendants of shakespeare.\\n\\nshakespeare\\'s fellow-actors, fellow-dramatists, and those who knew him\\nin other ways, agree in expressing not only admiration of his genius,\\nbut their respect and love for the man. ben jonson said, “i love the\\nman, and do honor his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any. he\\nwas indeed honest, and of an open and free nature.” he was buried on\\nthe second day after his death, on the north side of the chancel\\nof stratford church. over his grave there is a flat stone with this\\ninscription, said to have been written by himself:\\n\\n    good friend for jesus sake forbeare\\n    to digg the dust encloased heare:\\n    blest be ye man yt spares these stones,\\n    and curst be he yt moves my bones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncontents\\n\\n                                                     page\\n

aunt\\'s house at a place\\nbeyond the reach of that cruel law; and there he would come to her and\\nmarry her. but before she started, she told her friend, helena, what she\\nwas going to do.\\n\\nhelena had been demetrius\\' sweetheart long before his marriage with\\nhermia had been thought of, and being very silly, like all jealous\\npeople, she could not see that it was not poor hermia\\'s fault that\\ndemetrius wished to marry her instead of his own lady, helena. she knew\\nthat if she told demetrius that hermia was going, as she was, to the\\nwood outside athens, he would follow her, “and i can follow him, and\\nat least i shall see him,” she said to herself. so she went to him, and\\nbetrayed her friend\\'s secret.\\n\\nnow this wood where lysander was to meet hermia, and where the other two\\nhad decided to follow them, was full of fairies, as most woods are, if\\none only had the eyes to see them, and in this wood on this night were\\nthe king and queen of the fairies, oberon and titania. now fairies\\nare very wise people, but now and then they can be quite as foolish as\\nmortal folk. oberon and titania, who might have been as happy as the\\ndays were long, had thrown away all their joy in a foolish quarrel. they\\nnever met without saying disagreeable things to each other, and scolded\\neach other so dreadfully that all their little fairy followers, for\\nfear, would creep into acorn cups and hide them there.\\n\\nso, instead of keeping one happy court and dancing all night through in\\nthe moonlight as is fairies\\' use, the king with his attendants wandered\\nthrough one part of the wood, while the queen with hers kept state in\\nanother. and the cause of all this trouble was a little indian boy whom\\ntitania had taken to be one of her followers. oberon wanted the child to\\nfollow him and be one of his fairy knights; but the queen would not give\\nhim up.\\n\\non this night, in a mossy moonlit glade, the king and queen of the\\nfairies met.\\n\\n“ill met by moonlight, proud titania,” said the king.\\n\\n“what! jealous, oberon?” answered the queen. “you spoil everything with\\nyour quarreling. come, fairies, let us leave him. i am not friends with\\nhim now.”\\n\\n“it rests with you to make up the quarrel,” said the king.\\n\\n“give me that little indian boy, and i will again be your humble servant\\nand suitor.”\\n\\n“set your mind at rest,” said the queen. “your whole fairy kingdom buys\\nnot that boy from me. come, fairies.”\\n\\nand she and her train rode off down the moonbeams.\\n\\n“well, go your ways,” said oberon. “but i\\'ll be even with you before you\\nleave this wood.”\\n\\nthen oberon called his favorite fairy, puck. puck was the spirit of\\nmischief. he used to slip into the dairies and take the cream away, and\\nget into the churn so that the butter would not come, and turn the beer\\nsour, and lead people out of their way on dark nights and then laugh at\\nthem, and tumble people\\'s stools from under them when they were going to\\nsit down, and upset their hot ale over their chins when they were going\\nto drink.\\n\\n“now,” said oberon to this little sprite, “fetch me the flower called\\nlove-in-idleness. the juice of that little purple flower laid on the\\neyes of those who sleep will make them, when they wake, to love the\\nfirst thing they see. i will put some of the juice of that flower on\\nmy titania\\'s eyes, and when she wakes she will love the first thing she\\nsees, were it lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, or meddling monkey, or a\\nbusy ape.”\\n\\nwhile puck was gone, demetrius passed through the glade followed by poor\\nhelena, and still she told him how she loved him and reminded him of all\\nhis promises, and still he told her that he did not and could not love\\nher, and that his promises were nothing. oberon was sorry for poor\\nhelena, and when puck returned with the flower, he bade him follow\\ndemetrius and put some of the juice on his eyes, so that he might love\\nhelena when he woke and looked on her, as much as she loved him. so\\npuck set off, and wandering through the wood found, not demetrius, but\\nlysander, on whose eyes he put the juice; but when lysander woke, he saw\\nnot his own hermia, but helena, who was walking through the wood looking\\nfor the cruel demetrius; and directly he saw her he loved her and left\\nhis own lady, under the spell of the purple flower.\\n\\nwhen hermia woke she found lysander gone, and wandered about the wood\\ntrying to find him. puck went back and told oberon what he had done,\\nand oberon soon found that he had made a mistake, and set about looking\\nfor demetrius, and having found him, put some of the juice on his eyes.\\nand the first thing demetrius saw when he woke was also helena. so now\\ndemetrius and lysander were both following her through the wood, and it\\nwas hermia\\'s turn to follow her lover as helena had done before. the\\nend of it was that helena and hermia began to quarrel, and demetrius and\\nlysander went off to fight. oberon was very sorry to see his kind scheme\\nto help these lovers turn out so badly. so he said to puck--\\n\\n“these two young men are going to fight. you must overhang the night\\nwith drooping fog, and lead them so astray, that one will never find the\\nother. when they are tired out, they will fall asleep. then drop this\\nother herb on lysander\\'s eyes. that will give him his old sight and his\\nold love. then each man will have the lady who loves him, and they will\\nall think that this has been only a midsummer night\\'s dream. then when\\nthis is done, all will be well with them.”\\n\\nso puck went and did as he was told, and when the two had fallen asleep\\nwithout meeting each other, puck poured the juice on lysander\\'s eyes,\\nand said:--\\n\\n       “when thou wakest,\\n        thou takest\\n        true delight\\n        in the sight\\n        of thy former lady\\'s eye:\\n        jack shall have jill;\\n        nought shall go ill.”\\n\\nmeanwhile oberon found titania asleep on a bank where grew wild thyme,\\noxlips, and violets, and woodbine, musk-roses and eglantine. there\\ntitania always slept a part of the night, wrapped in the enameled skin\\nof a snake. oberon stooped over her and laid the juice on her eyes,\\nsaying:--\\n\\n       “what thou seest when thou wake,\\n        do it for thy true love take.”\\n\\nnow, it happened that when titania woke the first thing she saw was a\\nstupid clown, one of a party of players who had come out into the wood\\nto rehearse their play. this clown had met with puck, who had clapped\\nan ass\\'s head on his shoulders so that it looked as if it grew there.\\ndirectly titania woke and saw this dreadful monster, she said, “what\\nangel is this? are you as wise as you are beautiful?”\\n\\n“if i am wise enough to find my way out of this wood, that\\'s enough for\\nme,” said the foolish clown.\\n\\n“do not desire to go out of the wood,” said titania. the spell of the\\nlove-juice was on her, and to her the clown seemed the most beautiful\\nand delightful creature on all the earth. “i love you,” she went on.\\n“come with me, and i will give you fairies to attend on you.”\\n\\nso she called four fairies, whose names were peaseblossom, cobweb, moth,\\nand mustardseed.\\n\\n“you must attend this gentleman,” said the queen. “feed him with\\napricots and dewberries, purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.\\nsteal honey-bags for him from the bumble-bees, and with the wings of\\npainted butterflies fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.”\\n\\n“i will,” said one of the fairies, and all the others said, “i will.”\\n\\n“now, sit down with me,” said the queen to the clown, “and let me stroke\\nyour dear cheeks, and stick musk-roses in your smooth, sleek head, and\\nkiss your fair large ears, my gentle joy.”\\n\\n“where\\'s peaseblossom?” asked the clown with the ass\\'s head. he did not\\ncare much about the queen\\'s affection, but he was very proud of having\\nfairies to wait on him. “ready,” said peaseblossom.\\n\\n“scratch my head, peaseblossom,” said the clown. “where\\'s cobweb?”\\n “ready,” said cobweb.\\n\\n“kill me,” said the clown, “the red bumble-bee on the top of the thistle\\nyonder, and bring me the honey-bag. where\\'s mustardseed?”\\n\\n“ready,” said mustardseed.\\n\\n“oh, i want nothing,” said the clown. “only just help cobweb to scratch.\\ni must go to the barber\\'s, for methinks i am marvelous hairy about the\\nface.”\\n\\n“would you like anything to eat?” said the fairy queen.\\n\\n“i should like some good dry oats,” said the clown--for his donkey\\'s\\nhead made him desire donkey\\'s food--“and some hay to follow.”\\n\\n“shall some of my fairies fetch you new nuts from the squirrel\\'s house?”\\n asked the queen.\\n\\n“i\\'d rather have a handful or two of good dried peas,” said the clown.\\n“but please don\\'t let any of your people disturb me; i am going to\\nsleep.”\\n\\nthen said the queen, “and i will wind thee in my arms.”\\n\\nand so when oberon came along he found his beautiful queen lavishing\\nkisses and endearments on a clown with a donkey\\'s head.\\n\\nand before he released her from the enchantment, he persuaded her to\\ngive him the little indian boy he so much desired to have. then he took\\npity on her, and threw some juice of the disenchanting flower on her\\npretty eyes; and then in a moment she saw plainly the donkey-headed\\nclown she had been loving, and knew how foolish she had been.\\n\\noberon took off the ass\\'s head from the clown, and left him to finish\\nhis sleep with his own silly head lying on the thyme and violets.\\n\\nthus all was made plain and straight again. oberon and titania loved\\neach other more than ever. demetrius thought of no one but helena, and\\nhelena had never had any thought of anyone but demetrius.\\n\\nas for hermia and lysander, they were as loving a couple as you could\\nmeet in a day\\'s march, even through a fairy wood.\\n\\nso the four mortal lovers went back to athens and were married; and the\\nfairy king and queen live happily together in that very wood at this\\nvery day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe tempest\\n\\n\\n\\nprospero, the duke of milan, was a learned and studious man, who lived\\namong his books, leaving the management of his dukedom to his brother\\nantonio, in whom indeed he had complete trust. but that trust was\\nill-rewarded, for antonio wanted to wear the duke\\'s crown himself, and,\\nto gain his ends, would have killed his brother but for the love the\\npeople bore him. however, with the help of prospero\\'s great enemy,\\nalonso, king of naples, he managed to get into his hands the dukedom\\nwith all its honor, power, and riches. for they took prospero to sea,\\nand when they were far away from land, forced him into a little boat\\nwith no tackle, mast, or sail. in their cruelty and hatred they put his\\nlittle daughter, miranda (not yet three years old), into the boat with\\nhim, and sailed away, leaving them to their fate.\\n\\nbut one among the courtiers with antonio was true to his rightful\\nmaster, prospero. to save the duke from his enemies was impossible, but\\nmuch could be done to remind him of a subject\\'s love. so this worthy\\nlord, whose name was gonzalo, secretly placed in the boat some fresh\\nwater, provisions, and clothes, and what prospero valued most of all,\\nsome of his precious books.\\n\\nthe boat was cast on an island, and prospero and his little one landed\\nin safety. now this island was enchanted, and for years had lain under\\nthe spell of a fell witch, sycorax, who had imprisoned in the trunks\\nof trees all the good spirits she found there. she died shortly before\\nprospero was cast on those shores, but the spirits, of whom ariel was\\nthe chief, still remained in their prisons.\\n\\nprospero was a great magician, for he had devoted himself almost\\nentirely to the study of magic during the years in which he allowed\\nhis brother to manage the affairs of milan. by his art he set free the\\nimprisoned spirits, yet kept them obedient to his will, and they were\\nmore truly his subjects than his people in milan had been. for he\\ntreated them kindly as long as they did his bidding, and he exercised\\nhis power over them wisely and well. one creature alone he found it\\nnecessary to treat with harshness: this was caliban, the son of the\\nwicked old witch, a hideous, deformed monster, horrible to look on, and\\nvicious and brutal in all his habits.\\n\\nwhen miranda was grown up into a maiden, sweet and fair to see, it\\nchanced that antonio and alonso, with sebastian, his brother, and\\nferdinand, his son, were at sea together with old gonzalo, and their\\nship came near prospero\\'s island. prospero, knowing they were there,\\nraised by his art a great storm, so that even the sailors on board gave\\nthemselves up for lost; and first among them all prince ferdinand leaped\\ninto the sea, and, as his father thought in his grief, was drowned. but\\nariel brought him safe ashore; and all the rest of the crew, although\\nthey were washed overboard, were landed unhurt in different parts of\\nthe island, and the good ship herself, which they all thought had been\\nwrecked, lay at anchor in the harbor whither ariel had brought her. such\\nwonders could prospero and his spirits perform.\\n\\nwhile yet the tempest was raging, prospero showed his daughter the brave\\nship laboring in the trough of the sea, and told her that it was filled\\nwith living human beings like themselves. she, in pity of their lives,\\nprayed him who had raised this storm to quell it. then her father bade\\nher to have no fear, for he intended to save every one of them.\\n\\nthen, for the first time, he told her the story of his life and hers,\\nand that he had caused this storm to rise in order that his enemies,\\nantonio and alonso, who were on board, might be delivered into his\\nhands.\\n\\nwhen he had made an end of his story he charmed her into sleep, for\\nariel was at hand, and he had work for him to do. ariel, who longed\\nfor his complete freedom, grumbled to be kept in drudgery, but on being\\nthreateningly reminded of all the sufferings he had undergone when\\nsycorax ruled in the land, and of the debt of gratitude he owed to the\\nmaster who had made those sufferings to end, he ceased to complain, and\\npromised faithfully to do whatever prospero might command.\\n\\n“do so,” said prospero, “and in two days i will discharge thee.”\\n\\nthen he bade ariel take the form of a water nymph and sent him in search\\nof the young prince. and ariel, invisible to ferdinand, hovered near\\nhim, singing the while--\\n\\n   “come unto these yellow sands\\n      and then take hands:\\n    court\\'sied when you have, and kiss\\'d\\n      (the wild waves whist),\\n    foot it featly here and there;\\n    and, sweet sprites, the burden bear!”\\n\\nand ferdinand followed the magic singing, as the song changed to a\\nsolemn air, and the words brought grief to his heart, and tears to his\\neyes, for thus they ran--\\n\\n   “full fathom five thy father lies;\\n      of his bones are coral made.\\n    those are pearls that were his eyes,\\n      nothing of him that doth fade,\\n    but doth suffer a sea-change\\n    into something rich and strange.\\n    sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.\\n    hark! now i hear them,-- ding dong bell!”\\n\\nand so singing, ariel led the spell-bound prince into the presence of\\nprospero and miranda. then, behold! all happened as prospero desired.\\nfor miranda, who had never, since she could first remember, seen\\nany human being save her father, looked on the youthful prince with\\nreverence in her eyes, and love in her secret heart.\\n\\n“i might call him,” she said, “a thing divine, for nothing natural i\\never saw so noble!”\\n\\nand ferdinand, beholding her beauty with wonder and delight, exclaimed--\\n\\n“most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend!”\\n\\nnor did he attempt to hide the passion which she inspired in him, for\\nscarcely had they exchanged half a dozen sentences, before he vowed to\\nmake her his queen if she were willing. but prospero, though secretly\\ndelighted, pretended wrath.\\n\\n“you come here as a spy,” he said to ferdinand. “i will manacle your\\nneck and feet together, and you shall feed on fresh water mussels,\\nwithered roots and husk, and have sea-water to drink. follow.”\\n\\n“no,” said ferdinand, and drew his sword. but on the instant prospero\\ncharmed him so that he stood there like a statue, still as stone; and\\nmiranda in terror prayed her father to have mercy on her lover. but he\\nharshly refused her, and made ferdinand follow him to his cell. there\\nhe set the prince to work, making him remove thousands of heavy logs of\\ntimber and pile them up; and ferdinand patiently obeyed, and thought his\\ntoil all too well repaid by the sympathy of the sweet miranda.\\n\\nshe in very pity would have helped him in his hard work, but he would\\nnot let her, yet he could not keep from her the secret of his love, and\\nshe, hearing it, rejoiced and promised to be his wife.\\n\\nthen prospero released him from his servitude, and glad at heart, he\\ngave his consent to their marriage.\\n\\n“take her,” he said, “she is thine own.”\\n\\nin the meantime, antonio and sebastian in another part of the island\\nwere plotting the murder of alonso, the king of naples, for ferdinand\\nbeing dead, as they thought, sebastian would succeed to the throne on\\nalonso\\'s death. and they would have carried out their wicked purpose\\nwhile their victim was asleep, but that ariel woke him in good time.\\n\\nmany tricks did ariel play them. once he set a banquet before them, and\\njust as they were going to fall to, he appeared to them amid thunder\\nand lightning in the form of a harpy, and immediately the banquet\\ndisappeared. then ariel upbraided them with their sins and vanished too.\\n\\nprospero by his enchantments drew them all to the grove without his\\ncell, where they waited, trembling and afraid, and now at last bitterly\\nrepenting them of their sins.\\n\\nprospero determined to make one last use of his magic power, “and then,”\\n said he, “i\\'ll break my staff and deeper than did ever plummet sound\\ni\\'ll drown my book.”\\n\\nso he made heavenly music to sound in the air, and appeared to them in\\nhis proper shape as the duke of milan. because they repented, he\\nforgave them and told them the story of his life since they had cruelly\\ncommitted him and his baby daughter to the mercy of wind and waves.\\nalonso, who seemed sorriest of them all for his past crimes, lamented\\nthe loss of his heir. but prospero drew back a curtain and showed them\\nferdinand and miranda playing at chess. great was alonso\\'s joy to greet\\nhis loved son again, and when he heard that the fair maid with whom\\nferdinand was playing was prospero\\'s daughter, and that the young folks\\nhad plighted their troth, he said--\\n\\n“give me your hands, let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart that\\ndoth not wish you joy.”\\n\\nso all ended happily. the ship was safe in the harbor, and next day they\\nall set sail for naples, where ferdinand and miranda were to be married.\\nariel gave them calm seas and auspicious gales; and many were the\\nrejoicings at the wedding.\\n\\nthen prospero, after many years of absence, went back to his own\\ndukedom, where he was welcomed with great joy by his faithful subjects.\\nhe practiced the arts of magic no more, but his life was happy, and not\\nonly because he had found his own again, but chiefly because, when his\\nbitterest foes who had done him deadly wrong lay at his mercy, he took\\nno vengeance on them, but nobly forgave them.\\n\\nas for ariel, prospero made him free as air, so that he could wander\\nwhere he would, and sing with a light heart his sweet song--\\n\\n   “where the bee sucks, there suck i:\\n    in a cowslip\\'s bell i lie;\\n    there i couch when owls do cry.\\n    on the bat\\'s back i do fly\\n    after summer, merrily:\\n    merrily, merrily, shall i live now,\\n    under the blossom that hangs on the bough.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nas you like it\\n\\n\\n\\nthere was once a wicked duke named frederick, who took the dukedom that\\nshould have belonged to his brother, sending him into exile. his\\nbrother went into the forest of arden, where he lived the life of a bold\\nforester, as robin hood did in sherwood forest in merry england.\\n\\nthe banished duke\\'s daughter, rosalind, remained with celia, frederick\\'s\\ndaughter, and the two loved each other more than most sisters. one day\\nthere was a wrestling match at court, and rosalind and celia went to see\\nit. charles, a celebrated wrestler, was there, who had killed many men\\nin contests of this kind. orlando, the young man he was to wrestle with,\\nwas so slender and youthful, that rosalind and celia thought he would\\nsurely be killed, as others had been; so they spoke to him, and asked\\nhim not to attempt so dangerous an adventure; but the only effect of\\ntheir words was to make him wish more to come off well in the encounter,\\nso as to win praise from such sweet ladies.\\n\\norlando, like rosalind\\'s father, was being kept out of his inheritance\\nby his brother, and was so sad at his brother\\'s unkindness that, until\\nhe saw rosalind, he did not care much whether he lived or died. but now\\nthe sight of the fair rosalind gave him strength and courage, so that\\nhe did marvelously, and at last, threw charles to such a tune, that the\\nwrestler had to be carried off the ground. duke frederick was pleased\\nwith his courage, and asked his name.\\n\\n“my name is orlando, and i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys,”\\n said the young man.\\n\\nnow sir rowland de boys, when he was alive, had been a good friend to\\nthe banished duke, so that frederick heard with regret whose son orlando\\nwas, and would not befriend him. but rosalind was delighted to hear that\\nthis handsome young stranger was the son of her father\\'s old friend, and\\nas they were going away, she turned back more than once to say another\\nkind word to the brave young man.\\n\\n“gentleman,” she said, giving him a chain from her neck, “wear this for\\nme. i could give more, but that my hand lacks means.”\\n\\nrosalind and celia, when they were alone, began to talk about the\\nhandsome wrestler, and rosalind confessed that she loved him at first\\nsight.\\n\\n“come, come,” said celia, “wrestle with thy affections.”\\n\\n“oh,” answered rosalind, “they take the part of a better wrestler than\\nmyself. look, here comes the duke.”\\n\\n“with his eyes full of anger,” said celia.\\n\\n“you must leave the court at once,” he said to rosalind. “why?” she\\nasked.\\n\\n“never mind why,” answered the duke, “you are banished. if within ten\\ndays you are found within twenty miles of my court, you die.”\\n\\nso rosalind set out to seek her father, the banished duke, in the forest\\nof arden. celia loved her too much to let her go alone, and as it was\\nrather a dangerous journey, rosalind, being the taller, dressed up as\\na young countryman, and her cousin as a country girl, and rosalind said\\nthat she would be called ganymede, and celia, aliena. they were very\\ntired when at last they came to the forest of arden, and as they were\\nsitting on the grass a countryman passed that way, and ganymede\\nasked him if he could get them food. he did so, and told them that\\na shepherd\\'s flocks and house were to be sold. they bought these and\\nsettled down as shepherd and shepherdess in the forest.\\n\\nin the meantime, oliver having sought to take his brother orlando\\'s\\nlife, orlando also wandered into the forest, and there met with the\\nrightful duke, and being kindly received, stayed with him. now, orlando\\ncould think of nothing but rosalind, and he went about the forest\\ncarving her name on trees, and writing love sonnets and hanging them on\\nthe bushes, and there rosalind and celia found them. one day orlando met\\nthem, but he did not know rosalind in her boy\\'s clothes, though he liked\\nthe pretty shepherd youth, because he fancied a likeness in him to her\\nhe loved.\\n\\n“there is a foolish lover,” said rosalind, “who haunts these woods and\\nhangs sonnets on the trees. if i could find him, i would soon cure him\\nof his folly.”\\n\\norlando confessed that he was the foolish lover, and rosalind said--“if\\nyou will come and see me every day, i will pretend to be rosalind, and i\\nwill take her part, and be wayward and contrary, as is the way of women,\\ntill i make you ashamed of your folly in loving her.”\\n\\nand so every day he went to her house, and took a pleasure in saying to\\nher all the pretty things he would have said to rosalind; and she had\\nthe fine and secret joy of knowing that all his love-words came to the\\nright ears. thus many days passed pleasantly away.\\n\\none morning, as orlando was going to visit ganymede, he saw a man asleep\\non the ground, and that there was a lioness crouching near, waiting for\\nthe man who was asleep to wake: for they say that lions will not prey on\\nanything that is dead or sleeping. then orlando looked at the man, and\\nsaw that it was his wicked brother, oliver, who had tried to take his\\nlife. he fought with the lioness and killed her, and saved his brother\\'s\\nlife.\\n\\nwhile orlando was fighting the lioness, oliver woke to see his brother,\\nwhom he had treated so badly, saving him from a wild beast at the risk\\nof his own life. this made him repent of his wickedness, and he begged\\norlando\\'s pardon, and from thenceforth they were dear brothers. the\\nlioness had wounded orlando\\'s arm so much, that he could not go on to\\nsee the shepherd, so he sent his brother to ask ganymede to come to him.\\n\\noliver went and told the whole story to ganymede and aliena, and aliena\\nwas so charmed with his manly way of confessing his faults, that she\\nfell in love with him at once. but when ganymede heard of the danger\\norlando had been in she fainted; and when she came to herself, said\\ntruly enough, “i should have been a woman by right.”\\n\\noliver went back to his brother and told him all this, saying, “i love\\naliena so well that i will give up my estates to you and marry her, and\\nlive here as a shepherd.”\\n\\n“let your wedding be to-morrow,” said orlando, “and i will ask the duke\\nand his friends.”\\n\\nwhen orlando told ganymede how his brother was to be married on the\\nmorrow, he added: “oh, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness\\nthrough another man\\'s eyes.”\\n\\nthen answered rosalind, still in ganymede\\'s dress and speaking with his\\nvoic--“if you do love rosalind so near the heart, then when your brother\\nmarries aliena, shall you marry her.”\\n\\nnow the next day the duke and his followers, and orlando, and oliver,\\nand aliena, were all gathered together for the wedding.\\n\\nthen ganymede came in and said to the duke, “if i bring in your daughter\\nrosalind, will you give her to orlando here?” “that i would,” said the\\nduke, “if i had all kingdoms to give with her.”\\n\\n“and you say you will have her when i bring her?” she said to orlando.\\n“that would i,” he answered, “were i king of all kingdoms.”\\n\\nthen rosalind and celia went out, and rosalind put on her pretty woman\\'s\\nclothes again, and after a while came back.\\n\\nshe turned to her father--“i give myself to you, for i am yours.” “if\\nthere be truth in sight,” he said, “you are my daughter.”\\n\\nthen she said to orlando, “i give myself to you, for i am yours.” “if\\nthere be truth in sight,” he said, “you are my rosalind.”\\n\\n“i will have no father if you be not he,” she said to the duke, and to\\norlando, “i will have no husband if you be not he.”\\n\\nso orlando and rosalind were married, and oliver and celia, and they\\nlived happy ever after, returning with the duke to the kingdom. for\\nfrederick had been shown by a holy hermit the wickedness of his ways,\\nand so gave back the dukedom of his brother, and himself went into a\\nmonastery to pray for forgiveness.\\n\\nthe wedding was a merry one, in the mossy glades of the forest. a\\nshepherd and shepherdess who had been friends with rosalind, when she\\nwas herself disguised as a shepherd, were married on the same day, and\\nall with such pretty feastings and merrymakings as could be nowhere\\nwithin four walls, but only in the beautiful green wood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe winter\\'s tale\\n\\n\\n\\nleontes was the king of sicily, and his dearest friend was polixenes,\\nking of bohemia. they had been brought up together, and only separated\\nwhen they reached man\\'s estate and each had to go and rule over\\nhis kingdom. after many years, when each was married and had a son,\\npolixenes came to stay with leontes in sicily.\\n\\nleontes was a violent-tempered man and rather silly, and he took it into\\nhis stupid head that his wife, hermione, liked polixenes better than\\nshe did him, her own husband. when once he had got this into his head,\\nnothing could put it out; and he ordered one of his lords, camillo, to\\nput a poison in polixenes\\' wine. camillo tried to dissuade him from this\\nwicked action, but finding he was not to be moved, pretended to consent.\\nhe then told polixenes what was proposed against him, and they fled from\\nthe court of sicily that night, and returned to bohemia, where camillo\\nlived on as polixenes\\' friend and counselor.\\n\\nleontes threw the queen into prison; and her son, the heir to the\\nthrone, died of sorrow to see his mother so unjustly and cruelly\\ntreated.\\n\\nwhile the queen was in prison she had a little baby, and a friend of\\nhers, named paulina, had the baby dressed in its best, and took it to\\nshow the king, thinking that the sight of his helpless little daughter\\nwould soften his heart towards his dear queen, who had never done him\\nany wrong, and who loved him a great deal more than he deserved; but the\\nking would not look at the baby, and ordered paulina\\'s husband to take\\nit away in a ship, and leave it in the most desert and dreadful place\\nhe could find, which paulina\\'s husband, very much against his will, was\\nobliged to do.\\n\\nthen the poor queen was brought up to be tried for treason in preferring\\npolixenes to her king; but really she had never thought of anyone except\\nleontes, her husband. leontes had sent some messengers to ask the god,\\napollo, whether he was not right in his cruel thoughts of the queen. but\\nhe had not patience to wait till they came back, and so it happened that\\nthey arrived in the middle of the trial. the oracle said--\\n\\n“hermione is innocent, polixenes blameless, camillo a true subject,\\nleontes a jealous tyrant, and the king shall live without an heir, if\\nthat which is lost be not found.”\\n\\nthen a man came and told them that the little prince was dead. the\\npoor queen, hearing this, fell down in a fit; and then the king saw how\\nwicked and wrong he had been. he ordered paulina and the ladies who were\\nwith the queen to take her away, and try to restore her. but paulina\\ncame back in a few moments, and told the king that hermione was dead.\\n\\nnow leontes\\' eyes were at last opened to his folly. his queen was dead,\\nand the little daughter who might have been a comfort to him he had sent\\naway to be the prey of wolves and kites. life had nothing left for him\\nnow. he gave himself up to his grief, and passed in any sad years in\\nprayer and remorse.\\n\\nthe baby princess was left on the seacoast of bohemia, the very kingdom\\nwhere polixenes reigned. paulina\\'s husband never went home to tell\\nleontes where he had left the baby; for as he was going back to the\\nship, he met a bear and was torn to pieces. so there was an end of him.\\n\\nbut the poor deserted little baby was found by a shepherd. she was\\nrichly dressed, and had with her some jewels, and a paper was pinned to\\nher cloak, saying that her name was perdita, and that she came of noble\\nparents.\\n\\nthe shepherd, being a kind-hearted man, took home the little baby to\\nhis wife, and they brought it up as their own child. she had no more\\nteaching than a shepherd\\'s child generally has, but she inherited from\\nher royal mother many graces and charms, so that she was quite different\\nfrom the other maidens in the village where she lived.\\n\\none day prince florizel, the son of the good king of bohemia, was\\nbunting near the shepherd\\'s house and saw perdita, now grown up to a\\ncharming woman. he made friends with the shepherd, not telling him that\\nhe was the prince, but saying that his name was doricles, and that he\\nwas a private gentleman; and then, being deeply in love with the pretty\\nperdita, he came almost daily to see her.\\n\\nthe king could not understand what it was that took his son nearly every\\nday from home; so he set people to watch him, and then found out that\\nthe heir of the king of bohemia was in love with perdita, the pretty\\nshepherd girl. polixenes, wishing to see whether this was true,\\ndisguised himself, and went with the faithful camillo, in disguise\\ntoo, to the old shepherd\\'s house. they arrived at the feast of\\nsheep-shearing, and, though strangers, they were made very welcome.\\nthere was dancing going on, and a peddler was selling ribbons and laces\\nand gloves, which the young men bought for their sweethearts.\\n\\nflorizel and perdita, however, were taking no part in this gay scene,\\nbut sat quietly together talking. the king noticed the charming manners\\nand great beauty of perdita, never guessing that she was the daughter of\\nhis old friend, leontes. he said to camillo--\\n\\n“this is the prettiest low-born lass that ever ran on the green\\nsward. nothing she does or seems but smacks of something greater than\\nherself--too noble for this place.”\\n\\nand camillo answered, “in truth she is the queen of curds and cream.”\\n\\nbut when florizel, who did not recognize his father, called upon the\\nstrangers to witness his betrothal with the pretty shepherdess, the king\\nmade himself known and forbade the marriage, adding that if ever she saw\\nflorizel again, he would kill her and her old father, the shepherd; and\\nwith that he left them. but camillo remained behind, for he was charmed\\nwith perdita, and wished to befriend her.\\n\\ncamillo had long known how sorry leontes was for that foolish madness of\\nhis, and he longed to go back to sicily to see his old master. he now\\nproposed that the young people should go there and claim the protection\\nof leontes. so they went, and the shepherd went with them, taking\\nperdita\\'s jewels, her baby clothes, and the paper he had found pinned to\\nher cloak.\\n\\nleontes received them with great kindness. he was very polite to prince\\nflorizel, but all his looks were for perdita. he saw how much she was\\nlike the queen hermione, and said again and again--\\n\\n“such a sweet creature my daughter might have been, if i had not cruelly\\nsent her from me.”\\n\\nwhen the old shepherd heard that the king had lost a baby daughter, who\\nhad been left upon the coast of bohemia, he felt sure that perdita, the\\nchild he had reared, must be the king\\'s daughter, and when he told\\nhis tale and showed the jewels and the paper, the king perceived that\\nperdita was indeed his long-lost child. he welcomed her with joy, and\\nrewarded the good shepherd.\\n\\npolixenes had hastened after his son to prevent his marriage with\\nperdita, but when he found that she was the daughter of his old friend,\\nhe was only too glad to give his consent.\\n\\nyet leontes could not be happy. he remembered how his fair queen,\\nwho should have been at his side to share his joy in his daughter\\'s\\nhappiness, was dead through his unkindness, and he could say nothing for\\na long time but--\\n\\n“oh, thy mother! thy mother!” and ask forgiveness of the king of\\nbohemia, and then kiss his daughter again, and then the prince florizel,\\nand then thank the old shepherd for all his goodness.\\n\\nthen paulina, who had been high all these years in the king\\'s favor,\\nbecause of her kindness to the dead queen hermione, said--“i have a\\nstatue made in the likeness of the dead queen, a piece many years in\\ndoing, and performed by the rare italian master, giulio romano. i keep\\nit in a private house apart, and there, ever since you lost your queen,\\ni have gone twice or thrice a day. will it please your majesty to go and\\nsee the statue?”\\n\\nso leontes and polixenes, and florizel and perdita, with camillo and\\ntheir attendants, went to paulina\\'s house where there was a heavy purple\\ncurtain screening off an alcove; and paulina, with her hand on the\\ncurtain, said--\\n\\n“she was peerless when she was alive, and i do believe that her dead\\nlikeness excels whatever yet you have looked upon, or that the hand\\nof man hath done. therefore i keep it lonely, apart. but here it\\nis--behold, and say, \\'tis well.”\\n\\nand with that she drew back the curtain and showed them the statue. the\\nking gazed and gazed on the beautiful statue of his dead wife, but said\\nnothing.\\n\\n“i like your silence,” said paulina; “it the more shows off your wonder.\\nbut speak, is it not like her?”\\n\\n“it is almost herself,” said the king, “and yet, paulina, hermione was\\nnot so much wrinkled, nothing so old as this seems.”\\n\\n“oh, not by much,” said polixenes.\\n\\n“al,” said paulina, “that is the cleverness of the carver, who shows her\\nto us as she would have been had she lived till now.”\\n\\nand still leontes looked at the statue and could not take his eyes away.\\n\\n“if i had known,” said paulina, “that this poor image would so have\\nstirred your grief, and love, i would not have shown it to you.”\\n\\nbut he only answered, “do not draw the curtain.”\\n\\n“no, you must not look any longer,” said paulina, “or you will think it\\nmoves.”\\n\\n“let be! let be!” said the king. “would you not think it breathed?”\\n\\n“i will draw the curtain,” said paulina; “you will think it lives\\npresently.”\\n\\n“ah, sweet paulina,” said leontes, “make me to think so twenty years\\ntogether.”\\n\\n“if you can bear it,” said paulina, “i can make the statue move, make\\nit come down and take you by the hand. only you would think it was by\\nwicked magic.”\\n\\n“whatever you can make her do, i am content to look on,” said the king.\\n\\nand then, all folks there admiring and beholding, the statue moved from\\nits pedestal, and came down the steps and put its arms round the king\\'s\\nneck, and he held her face and kissed her many times, for this was\\nno statue, but the real living queen hermione herself. she had lived\\nhidden, by paulina\\'s kindness, all these years, and would not discover\\nherself to her husband, though she knew he had repented, because she\\ncould not quite forgive him till she knew what had become of her little\\nbaby.\\n\\nnow that perdita was found, she forgave her husband everything, and it\\nwas like a new and beautiful marriage to them, to be together once more.\\n\\nflorizel and perdita were married and lived long and happily.\\n\\nto leontes his many years of suffering were well paid for in the moment\\nwhen, after long grief and pain, he felt the arms of his true love\\naround him once again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nking lear\\n\\n\\n\\nking lear was old and tired. he was aweary of the business of his\\nkingdom, and wished only to end his days quietly near his three\\ndaughters. two of his daughters were married to the dukes of albany\\nand cornwall; and the duke of burgundy and the king of france were both\\nsuitors for the hand of cordelia, his youngest daughter.\\n\\nlear called his three daughters together, and told them that he proposed\\nto divide his kingdom between them. “but first,” said he, “i should like\\nto know much you love me.”\\n\\ngoneril, who was really a very wicked woman, and did not love her father\\nat all, said she loved him more than words could say; she loved him\\ndearer than eyesight, space or liberty, more than life, grace, health,\\nbeauty, and honor.\\n\\n“i love you as much as my sister and more,” professed regan, “since i\\ncare for nothing but my father\\'s love.”\\n\\nlear was very much pleased with regan\\'s professions, and turned to his\\nyoungest daughter, cordelia. “now, our joy, though last not least,” he\\nsaid, “the best part of my kingdom have i kept for you. what can you\\nsay?”\\n\\n“nothing, my lord,” answered cordelia.\\n\\n“nothing can come of nothing. speak again,” said the king.\\n\\nand cordelia answered, “i love your majesty according to my duty--no\\nmore, no less.”\\n\\nand this she said, because she was disgusted with the way in which her\\nsisters professed love, when really they had not even a right sense of\\nduty to their old father.\\n\\n“i am your daughter,” she went on, “and you have brought me up and loved\\nme, and i return you those duties back as are right and fit, obey you,\\nlove you, and most honor you.”\\n\\nlear, who loved cordelia best, had wished her to make more extravagant\\nprofessions of love than her sisters. “go,” he said, “be for ever a\\nstranger to my heart and me.”\\n\\nthe earl of kent, one of lear\\'s favorite courtiers and captains, tried\\nto say a word for cordelia\\'s sake, but lear would not listen. he divided\\nthe kingdom between goneril and regan, and told them that he should only\\nkeep a hundred knights at arms, and would live with his daughters by\\nturns.\\n\\nwhen the duke of burgundy knew that cordelia would have no share of the\\nkingdom, he gave up his courtship of her. but the king of france was\\nwiser, and said, “thy dowerless daughter, king, is queen of us--of ours,\\nand our fair france.”\\n\\n“take her, take her,” said the king; “for i will never see that face of\\nhers again.”\\n\\nso cordelia became queen of france, and the earl of kent, for having\\nventured to take her part, was banished from the kingdom. the king now\\nwent to stay with his daughter goneril, who had got everything from her\\nfather that he had to give, and now began to grudge even the hundred\\nknights that he had reserved for himself. she was harsh and undutiful\\nto him, and her servants either refused to obey his orders or pretended\\nthat they did not hear them.\\n\\nnow the earl of kent, when he was banished, made as though he would\\ngo into another country, but instead he came back in the disguise of\\na servingman and took service with the king. the king had now two\\nfriends--the earl of kent, whom he only knew as his servant, and his\\nfool, who was faithful to him. goneril told her father plainly that his\\nknights only served to fill her court with riot and feasting; and so she\\nbegged him only to keep a few old men about him such as himself.\\n\\n“my train are men who know all parts of duty,” said lear. “goneril, i\\nwill not trouble you further--yet i have left another daughter.”\\n\\nand his horses being saddled, he set out with his followers for the\\ncastle of regan. but she, who had formerly outdone her sister in\\nprofessions of attachment to the king, now seemed to outdo her in\\nundutiful conduct, saying that fifty knights were too many to wait on\\nhim, and goneril (who had hurried thither to prevent regan showing any\\nkindness to the old king) said five were too many, since her servants\\ncould wait on him.\\n\\nthen when lear saw that what they really wanted was to drive him away,\\nhe left them. it was a wild and stormy night, and he wandered about the\\nheath half mad with misery, and with no companion but the poor fool.\\nbut presently his servant, the good earl of kent, met him, and at last\\npersuaded him to lie down in a wretched little hovel. at daybreak the\\nearl of kent removed his royal master to dover, and hurried to the court\\nof france to tell cordelia what had happened.\\n\\ncordelia\\'s husband gave her an army and with it she landed at dover.\\nhere she found poor king lear, wandering about the fields, wearing a\\ncrown of nettles and weeds. they brought him back and fed and clothed\\nhim, and cordelia came to him and kissed him.\\n\\n“you must bear with me,” said lear; “forget and forgive. i am old and\\nfoolish.”\\n\\nand now he knew at last which of his children it was that had loved him\\nbest, and who was worthy of his love.\\n\\ngoneril and regan joined their armies to fight cordelia\\'s army, and were\\nsuccessful; and cordelia and her father were thrown into prison. then\\ngoneril\\'s husband, the duke of albany, who was a good man, and had not\\nknown how wicked his wife was, heard the truth of the whole story; and\\nwhen goneril found that her husband knew her for the wicked woman she\\nwas, she killed herself, having a little time before given a deadly\\npoison to her sister, regan, out of a spirit of jealousy.\\n\\nbut they had arranged that cordelia should be hanged in prison, and\\nthough the duke of albany sent messengers at once, it was too late. the\\nold king came staggering into the tent of the duke of albany, carrying\\nthe body of his dear daughter cordelia, in his arms.\\n\\nand soon after, with words of love for her upon his lips, he fell with\\nher still in his arms, and died.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwelfth night\\n\\n\\n\\norsino, the duke of illyria, was deeply in love with a beautiful\\ncountess named olivia. yet was all his love in vain, for she disdained\\nhis suit; and when her brother died, she sent back a messenger from the\\nduke, bidding him tell his master that for seven years she would not\\nlet the very air behold her face, but that, like a nun, she would walk\\nveiled; and all this for the sake of a dead brother\\'s love, which she\\nwould keep fresh and lasting in her sad remembrance.\\n\\nthe duke longed for someone to whom he could tell his sorrow, and repeat\\nover and over again the story of his love. and chance brought him such a\\ncompanion. for about this time a goodly ship was wrecked on the illyrian\\ncoast, and among those who reached land in safety were the captain and\\na fair young maid, named viola. but she was little grateful for being\\nrescued from the perils of the sea, since she feared that her twin\\nbrother was drowned, sebastian, as dear to her as the heart in her\\nbosom, and so like her that, but for the difference in their manner of\\ndress, one could hardly be told from the other. the captain, for her\\ncomfort, told her that he had seen her brother bind himself “to a strong\\nmast that lived upon the sea,” and that thus there was hope that he\\nmight be saved.\\n\\nviola now asked in whose country she was, and learning that the young\\nduke orsino ruled there, and was as noble in his nature as in his name,\\nshe decided to disguise herself in male attire, and seek for employment\\nwith him as a page.\\n\\nin this she succeeded, and now from day to day she had to listen to the\\nstory of orsino\\'s love. at first she sympathized very truly with him,\\nbut soon her sympathy grew to love. at last it occurred to orsino that\\nhis hopeless love-suit might prosper better if he sent this pretty lad\\nto woo olivia for him. viola unwillingly went on this errand, but when\\nshe came to the house, malvolio, olivia\\'s steward, a vain, officious\\nman, sick, as his mistress told him, of self-love, forbade the messenger\\nadmittance.\\n\\nviola, however (who was now called cesario), refused to take any denial,\\nand vowed to have speech with the countess. olivia, hearing how her\\ninstructions were defied and curious to see this daring youth, said,\\n“we\\'ll once more hear orsino\\'s embassy.”\\n\\nwhen viola was admitted to her presence and the servants had been sent\\naway, she listened patiently to the reproaches which this bold messenger\\nfrom the duke poured upon her, and listening she fell in love with the\\nsupposed cesario; and when cesario had gone, olivia longed to send some\\nlove-token after him. so, calling malvolio, she bade him follow the boy.\\n\\n“he left this ring behind him,” she said, taking one from her finger.\\n“tell him i will none of it.”\\n\\nmalvolio did as he was bid, and then viola, who of course knew perfectly\\nwell that she had left no ring behind her, saw with a woman\\'s quickness\\nthat olivia loved her. then she went back to the duke, very sad at heart\\nfor her lover, and for olivia, and for herself.\\n\\nit was but cold comfort she could give orsino, who now sought to ease\\nthe pangs of despised love by listening to sweet music, while cesario\\nstood by his side.\\n\\n“ah,” said the duke to his page that night, “you too have been in love.”\\n\\n“a little,” answered viola.\\n\\n“what kind of woman is it?” he asked.\\n\\n“of your complexion,” she answered.\\n\\n“what years, i\\' faith?” was his next question.\\n\\nto this came the pretty answer, “about your years, my lord.”\\n\\n“too old, by heaven!” cried the duke. “let still the woman take an elder\\nthan herself.”\\n\\nand viola very meekly said, “i think it well, my lord.”\\n\\nby and by orsino begged cesario once more to visit olivia and to plead\\nhis love-suit. but she, thinking to dissuade him, said--\\n\\n“if some lady loved you as you love olivia?”\\n\\n“ah! that cannot be,” said the duke.\\n\\n“but i know,” viola went on, “what love woman may have for a man. my\\nfather had a daughter loved a man, as it might be,” she added blushing,\\n“perhaps, were i a woman, i should love your lordship.”\\n\\n“and what is her history?” he asked.\\n\\n“a blank, my lord,” viola answered. “she never told her love, but let\\nconcealment like a worm in the bud feed on her damask cheek: she\\npined in thought, and with a green and yellow melancholy she sat, like\\npatience on a monument, smiling at grief. was not this love indeed?”\\n\\n“but died thy sister of her love, my boy?” the duke asked; and viola,\\nwho had all the time been telling her own love for him in this pretty\\nfashion, said--\\n\\n“i am all the daughters my father has and all the brothers-- sir, shall\\ni go to the lady?”\\n\\n“to her in haste,” said the duke, at once forgetting all about the\\nstory, “and give her this jewel.”\\n\\nso viola went, and this time poor olivia was unable to hide her love,\\nand openly confessed it with such passionate truth, that viola left her\\nhastily, saying--\\n\\n“nevermore will i deplore my master\\'s tears to you.”\\n\\nbut in vowing this, viola did not know the tender pity she would feel\\nfor other\\'s suffering. so when olivia, in the violence of her love,\\nsent a messenger, praying cesario to visit her once more, cesario had no\\nheart to refuse the request.\\n\\nbut the favors which olivia bestowed upon this mere page aroused the\\njealousy of sir andrew aguecheek, a foolish, rejected lover of hers, who\\nat that time was staying at her house with her merry old uncle sir toby.\\nthis same sir toby dearly loved a practical joke, and knowing sir andrew\\nto be an arrant coward, he thought that if he could bring off a duel\\nbetween him and cesario, there would be rare sport indeed. so he induced\\nsir andrew to send a challenge, which he himself took to cesario. the\\npoor page, in great terror, said--\\n\\n“i will return again to the house, i am no fighter.”\\n\\n“back you shall not to the house,” said sir toby, “unless you fight me\\nfirst.”\\n\\nand as he looked a very fierce old gentleman, viola thought it best to\\nawait sir andrew\\'s coming; and when he at last made his appearance, in\\na great fright, if the truth had been known, she tremblingly drew her\\nsword, and sir andrew in like fear followed her example. happily for\\nthem both, at this moment some officers of the court came on the scene,\\nand stopped the intended duel. viola gladly made off with what speed she\\nmight, while sir toby called after her--\\n\\n“a very paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare!”\\n\\nnow, while these things were happening, sebastian had escaped all\\nthe dangers of the deep, and had landed safely in illyria, where he\\ndetermined to make his way to the duke\\'s court. on his way thither he\\npassed olivia\\'s house just as viola had left it in such a hurry, and\\nwhom should he meet but sir andrew and sir toby. sir andrew, mistaking\\nsebastian for the cowardly cesario, took his courage in both hands, and\\nwalking up to him struck him, saying, “there\\'s for you.”\\n\\n“why, there\\'s for you; and there, and there!” said sebastian, bitting\\nback a great deal harder, and again and again, till sir toby came to\\nthe rescue of his friend. sebastian, however, tore himself free from sir\\ntoby\\'s clutches, and drawing his sword would have fought them both, but\\nthat olivia herself, having heard of the quarrel, came running in, and\\nwith many reproaches sent sir toby and his friend away. then turning\\nto sebastian, whom she too thought to be cesario, she besought him with\\nmany a pretty speech to come into the house with her.\\n\\nsebastian, half dazed and all delighted with her beauty and grace,\\nreadily consented, and that very day, so great was olivia\\'s baste,\\nthey were married before she had discovered that he was not cesario, or\\nsebastian was quite certain whether or not he was in a dream.\\n\\nmeanwhile orsino, hearing how ill cesario sped with olivia, visited her\\nhimself, taking cesario with him. olivia met them both before her\\ndoor, and seeing, as she thought, her husband there, reproached him for\\nleaving her, while to the duke she said that his suit was as fat and\\nwholesome to her as howling after music.\\n\\n“still so cruel?” said orsino.\\n\\n“still so constant,” she answered.\\n\\nthen orsino\\'s anger growing to cruelty, he vowed that, to be revenged on\\nher, he would kill cesario, whom he knew she loved. “come, boy,” he said\\nto the page.\\n\\nand viola, following him as he moved away, said, “i, to do you rest, a\\nthousand deaths would die.”\\n\\na great fear took hold on olivia, and she cried aloud, “cesario,\\nhusband, stay!”\\n\\n“her husband?” asked the duke angrily.\\n\\n“no, my lord, not i,” said viola.\\n\\n“call forth the holy father,” cried olivia.\\n\\nand the priest who had married sebastian and olivia, coming in, declared\\ncesario to be the bridegroom.\\n\\n“o thou dissembling cub!” the duke exclaimed. “farewell, and take her,\\nbut go where thou and i henceforth may never meet.”\\n\\nat this moment sir andrew came up with bleeding crown, complaining that\\ncesario had broken his head, and sir toby\\'s as well.\\n\\n“i never hurt you,” said viola, very positively; “you drew your sword on\\nme, but i bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.”\\n\\nyet, for all her protesting, no one there believed her; but all their\\nthoughts were on a sudden changed to wonder, when sebastian came in.\\n\\n“i am sorry, madam,” he said to his wife, “i have hurt your kinsman.\\npardon me, sweet, even for the vows we made each other so late ago.”\\n\\n“one face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!” cried the duke,\\nlooking first at viola, and then at sebastian.\\n\\n“an apple cleft in two,” said one who knew sebastian, “is not more twin\\nthan these two creatures. which is sebastian?”\\n\\n“i never had a brother,” said sebastian. “i had a sister, whom the blind\\nwaves and surges have devoured.” “were you a woman,” he said to viola,\\n“i should let my tears fall upon your cheek, and say, \\'thrice welcome,\\ndrowned viola!\\'”\\n\\nthen viola, rejoicing to see her dear brother alive, confessed that she\\nwas indeed his sister, viola. as she spoke, orsino felt the pity that is\\nakin to love.\\n\\n“boy,” he said, “thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never\\nshouldst love woman like to me.”\\n\\n“and all those sayings will i overswear,” viola replied, “and all those\\nswearings keep true.”\\n\\n“give me thy hand,” orsino cried in gladness. “thou shalt be my wife,\\nand my fancy\\'s queen.”\\n\\nthus was the gentle viola made happy, while olivia found in sebastian\\na constant lover, and a good husband, and he in her a true and loving\\nwife.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmuch ado about nothing\\n\\n\\n\\nin sicily is a town called messina, which is the scene of a curious\\nstorm in a teacup that raged several hundred years ago.\\n\\nit began with sunshine. don pedro, prince of arragon, in spain, had\\ngained so complete a victory over his foes that the very land whence\\nthey came is forgotten. feeling happy and playful after the fatigues of\\nwar, don pedro came for a holiday to messina, and in his suite were his\\nstepbrother don john and two young italian lords, benedick and claudio.\\n\\nbenedick was a merry chatterbox, who had determined to live a bachelor.\\nclaudio, on the other hand, no sooner arrived at messina than he fell in\\nlove with hero, the daughter of leonato, governor of messina.\\n\\none july day, a perfumer called borachio was burning dried lavender in\\na musty room in leonato\\'s house, when the sound of conversation floated\\nthrough the open window.\\n\\n“give me your candid opinion of hero,” claudio, asked, and borachio\\nsettled himself for comfortable listening.\\n\\n“too short and brown for praise,” was benedick\\'s reply; “but alter her\\ncolor or height, and you spoil her.”\\n\\n“in my eyes she is the sweetest of women,” said claudio.\\n\\n“not in mine,” retorted benedick, “and i have no need for glasses. she\\nis like the last day of december compared with the first of may if you\\nset her beside her cousin. unfortunately, the lady beatrice is a fury.”\\n\\nbeatrice was leonato\\'s niece. she amused herself by saying witty and\\nsevere things about benedick, who called her dear lady disdain. she\\nwas wont to say that she was born under a dancing star, and could not\\ntherefore be dull.\\n\\nclaudio and benedick were still talking when don pedro came up and said\\ngood-humoredly, “well, gentlemen, what\\'s the secret?”\\n\\n“i am longing,” answered benedick, “for your grace to command me to\\ntell.”\\n\\n“i charge you, then, on your allegiance to tell me,” said don pedro,\\nfalling in with his humor.\\n\\n“i can be as dumb as a mute,” apologized benedick to claudio, “but his\\ngrace commands my speech.” to don pedro he said, “claudio is in love\\nwith hero, leonato\\'s short daughter.”\\n\\ndon pedro was pleased, for he admired hero and was fond of claudio. when\\nbenedick had departed, he said to claudio, “be steadfast in your love\\nfor hero, and i will help you to win her. to-night her father gives a\\nmasquerade, and i will pretend i am claudio, and tell her how claudio\\nloves her, and if she be pleased, i will go to her father and ask his\\nconsent to your union.”\\n\\nmost men like to do their own wooing, but if you fall in love with a\\ngovernor\\'s only daughter, you are fortunate if you can trust a prince to\\nplead for you.\\n\\nclaudio then was fortunate, but he was unfortunate as well, for he\\nhad an enemy who was outwardly a friend. this enemy was don pedro\\'s\\nstepbrother don john, who was jealous of claudio because don pedro\\npreferred him to don john.\\n\\nit was to don john that borachio came with the interesting conversation\\nwhich he had overheard.\\n\\n“i shall have some fun at that masquerade myself,” said don john when\\nborachio ceased speaking.\\n\\non the night of the masquerade, don pedro, masked and pretending he was\\nclaudio, asked hero if he might walk with her.\\n\\nthey moved away together, and don john went up to claudio and said,\\n“signor benedick, i believe?” “the same,” fibbed claudio.\\n\\n“i should be much obliged then,” said don john, “if you would use your\\ninfluence with my brother to cure him of his love for hero. she is\\nbeneath him in rank.”\\n\\n“how do you know he loves her?” inquired claudio.\\n\\n“i heard him swear his affection,” was the reply, and borachio chimed in\\nwith, “so did i too.”\\n\\nclaudio was then left to himself, and his thought was that his prince\\nhad betrayed him. “farewell, hero,” he muttered; “i was a fool to trust\\nto an agent.”\\n\\nmeanwhile beatrice and benedick (who was masked) were having a brisk\\nexchange of opinions.\\n\\n“did benedick ever make you laugh?” asked she.\\n\\n“who is benedick?” he inquired.\\n\\n“a prince\\'s jester,” replied beatrice, and she spoke so sharply that “i\\nwould not marry her,” he declared afterwards, “if her estate were the\\ngarden of eden.”\\n\\nbut the principal speaker at the masquerade was neither beatrice nor\\nbenedick. it was don pedro, who carried out his plan to the letter, and\\nbrought the light back to claudio\\'s face in a twinkling, by appearing\\nbefore him with leonato and hero, and saying, “claudio, when would you\\nlike to go to church?”\\n\\n“to-morrow,” was the prompt answer. “time goes on crutches till i marry\\nhero.”\\n\\n“give her a week, my dear son,” said leonato, and claudio\\'s heart\\nthumped with joy.\\n\\n“and now,” said the amiable don pedro, “we must find a wife for signor\\nbenedick. it is a task for hercules.”\\n\\n“i will help you,” said leonato, “if i have to sit up ten nights.”\\n\\nthen hero spoke. “i will do what i can, my lord, to find a good husband\\nfor beatrice.”\\n\\nthus, with happy laughter, ended the masquerade which had given claudio\\na lesson for nothing.\\n\\nborachio cheered up don john by laying a plan before him with which he\\nwas confident he could persuade both claudio and don pedro that hero was\\na fickle girl who had two strings to her bow. don john agreed to this\\nplan of hate.\\n\\ndon pedro, on the other hand, had devised a cunning plan of love.\\n“if,” he said to leonato, “we pretend, when beatrice is near enough to\\noverhear us, that benedick is pining for her love, she will pity him,\\nsee his good qualities, and love him. and if, when benedick thinks we\\ndon\\'t know he is listening, we say how sad it is that the beautiful\\nbeatrice should be in love with a heartless scoffer like benedick, he\\nwill certainly be on his knees before her in a week or less.”\\n\\nso one day, when benedick was reading in a summer-house, claudio sat\\ndown outside it with leonato, and said, “your daughter told me something\\nabout a letter she wrote.”\\n\\n“letter!” exclaimed leonato. “she will get up twenty times in the night\\nand write goodness knows what. but once hero peeped, and saw the words\\n\\'benedick and beatrice\\' on the sheet, and then beatrice tore it up.”\\n\\n“hero told me,” said claudio, “that she cried, \\'o sweet benedick!\\'”\\n\\nbenedick was touched to the core by this improbable story, which he was\\nvain enough to believe. “she is fair and good,” he said to himself.\\n“i must not seem proud. i feel that i love her. people will laugh, of\\ncourse; but their paper bullets will do me no harm.”\\n\\nat this moment beatrice came to the summerhouse, and said, “against my\\nwill, i have come to tell you that dinner is ready.”\\n\\n“fair beatrice, i thank you,” said benedick.\\n\\n“i took no more pains to come than you take pains to thank me,” was the\\nrejoinder, intended to freeze him.\\n\\nbut it did not freeze him. it warmed him. the meaning he squeezed out of\\nher rude speech was that she was delighted to come to him.\\n\\nhero, who had undertaken the task of melting the heart of beatrice, took\\nno trouble to seek an occasion. she simply said to her maid margaret one\\nday, “run into the parlor and whisper to beatrice that ursula and i are\\ntalking about her in the orchard.”\\n\\nhaving said this, she felt as sure that beatrice would overhear what was\\nmeant for her ears as if she had made an appointment with her cousin.\\n\\nin the orchard was a bower, screened from the sun by honeysuckles, and\\nbeatrice entered it a few minutes after margaret had gone on her errand.\\n\\n“but are you sure,” asked ursula, who was one of hero\\'s attendants,\\n“that benedick loves beatrice so devotedly?”\\n\\n“so say the prince and my betrothed,” replied hero, “and they wished me\\nto tell her, but i said, \\'no! let benedick get over it.\\'”\\n\\n“why did you say that?”\\n\\n“because beatrice is unbearably proud. her eyes sparkle with disdain and\\nscorn. she is too conceited to love. i should not like to see her making\\ngame of poor benedick\\'s love. i would rather see benedick waste away\\nlike a covered fire.”\\n\\n“i don\\'t agree with you,” said ursula. “i think your cousin is too\\nclear-sighted not to see the merits of benedick.” “he is the one man in\\nitaly, except claudio,” said hero.\\n\\nthe talkers then left the orchard, and beatrice, excited and tender,\\nstepped out of the summer-house, saying to herself, “poor dear benedick,\\nbe true to me, and your love shall tame this wild heart of mine.”\\n\\nwe now return to the plan of hate.\\n\\nthe night before the day fixed for claudio\\'s wedding, don john entered\\na room in which don pedro and claudio were conversing, and asked claudio\\nif he intended to be married to-morrow.\\n\\n“you know he does!” said don pedro.\\n\\n“he may know differently,” said don john, “when he has seen what i will\\nshow him if he will follow me.”\\n\\nthey followed him into the garden; and they saw a lady leaning out of\\nhero\\'s window talking love to borachio.\\n\\nclaudio thought the lady was hero, and said, “i will shame her for it\\nto-morrow!” don pedro thought she was hero, too; but she was not hero;\\nshe was margaret.\\n\\ndon john chuckled noiselessly when claudio and don pedro quitted the\\ngarden; he gave borachio a purse containing a thousand ducats.\\n\\nthe money made borachio feel very gay, and when he was walking in the\\nstreet with his friend conrade, he boasted of his wealth and the giver,\\nand told what he had done.\\n\\na watchman overheard them, and thought that a man who had been paid a\\nthousand ducats for villainy was worth taking in charge. he therefore\\narrested borachio and conrade, who spent the rest of the night in\\nprison.\\n\\nbefore noon of the next day half the aristocrats in messina were at\\nchurch. hero thought it was her wedding day, and she was there in her\\nwedding dress, no cloud on her pretty face or in her frank and shining\\neyes.\\n\\nthe priest was friar francis.\\n\\nturning to claudio, he said, “you come hither, my lord, to marry this\\nlady?” “no!” contradicted claudio.\\n\\nleonato thought he was quibbling over grammar. “you should have said,\\nfriar,” said he, “\\'you come to be married to her.\\'”\\n\\nfriar francis turned to hero. “lady,” he said, “you come hither to be\\nmarried to this count?” “i do,” replied hero.\\n\\n“if either of you know any impediment to this marriage, i charge you to\\nutter it,” said the friar.\\n\\n“do you know of any, hero?” asked claudio. “none,” said she.\\n\\n“know you of any, count?” demanded the friar. “i dare reply for him,\\n\\'none,\\'” said leonato.\\n\\nclaudio exclaimed bitterly, “o! what will not men dare say! father,”\\n he continued, “will you give me your daughter?” “as freely,” replied\\nleonato, “as god gave her to me.”\\n\\n“and what can i give you,” asked claudio, “which is worthy of this\\ngift?” “nothing,” said don pedro, “unless you give the gift back to the\\ngiver.”\\n\\n“sweet prince, you teach me,” said claudio. “there, leonato, take her\\nback.”\\n\\nthese brutal words were followed by others which flew from claudio, don\\npedro and don john.\\n\\nthe church seemed no longer sacred. hero took her own part as long as\\nshe could, then she swooned. all her persecutors left the church, except\\nher father, who was befooled by the accusations against her, and cried,\\n“hence from her! let her die!”\\n\\nbut friar francis saw hero blameless with his clear eyes that probed the\\nsoul. “she is innocent,” he said; “a thousand signs have told me so.”\\n\\nhero revived under his kind gaze. her father, flurried and angry, knew\\nnot what to think, and the friar said, “they have left her as one dead\\nwith shame. let us pretend that she is dead until the truth is declared,\\nand slander turns to remorse.”\\n\\n“the friar advises well,” said benedick. then hero was led away into a\\nretreat, and beatrice and benedick remained alone in the church.\\n\\nbenedick knew she had been weeping bitterly and long. “surely i do\\nbelieve your fair cousin is wronged,” he said. she still wept.\\n\\n“is it not strange,” asked benedick, gently, “that i love nothing in the\\nworld as well as you?”\\n\\n“it were as possible for me to say i loved nothing as well as you,” said\\nbeatrice, “but i do not say it. i am sorry for my cousin.”\\n\\n“tell me what to do for her,” said benedick. “kill claudio.”\\n\\n“ha! not for the wide world,” said benedick. “your refusal kills me,”\\n said beatrice. “farewell.”\\n\\n“enough! i will challenge him,” cried benedick.\\n\\nduring this scene borachio and conrade were in prison. there they were\\nexamined by a constable called dogberry.\\n\\nthe watchman gave evidence to the effect that borachio had said that he\\nhad received a thousand ducats for conspiring against hero.\\n\\nleonato was not present at this examination, but he was nevertheless now\\nthoroughly convinced of hero\\'s innocence. he played the part of bereaved\\nfather very well, and when don pedro and claudio called on him in a\\nfriendly way, he said to the italian, “you have slandered my child to\\ndeath, and i challenge you to combat.”\\n\\n“i cannot fight an old man,” said claudio.\\n\\n“you could kill a girl,” sneered leonato, and claudio crimsoned.\\n\\nhot words grew from hot words, and both don pedro and claudio were\\nfeeling scorched when leonato left the room and benedick entered.\\n\\n“the old man,” said claudio, “was like to have snapped my nose off.”\\n\\n“you are a villain!” said benedick, shortly. “fight me when and with\\nwhat weapon you please, or i call you a coward.”\\n\\nclaudio was astounded, but said, “i\\'ll meet you. nobody shall say i\\ncan\\'t carve a calf\\'s head.”\\n\\nbenedick smiled, and as it was time for don pedro to receive officials,\\nthe prince sat down in a chair of state and prepared his mind for\\njustice.\\n\\nthe door soon opened to admit dogberry and his prisoners.\\n\\n“what offence,” said don pedro, “are these men charged with?”\\n\\nborachio thought the moment a happy one for making a clean breast of it.\\nhe laid the whole blame on don john, who had disappeared. “the lady hero\\nbeing dead,” he said, “i desire nothing but the reward of a murderer.”\\n\\nclaudio heard with anguish and deep repentance.\\n\\nupon the re-entrance of leonato be said to him, “this slave makes clear\\nyour daughter\\'s innocence. choose your revenge.\\n\\n“leonato,” said don pedro, humbly, “i am ready for any penance you may\\nimpose.”\\n\\n“i ask you both, then,” said leonato, “to proclaim my daughter\\'s\\ninnocence, and to honor her tomb by singing her praise before it. as for\\nyou, claudio, i have this to say: my brother has a daughter so like hero\\nthat she might be a copy of her. marry her, and my vengeful feelings\\ndie.”\\n\\n“noble sir,” said claudio, “i am yours.” claudio then went to his room\\nand composed a solemn song. going to the church with don pedro and his\\nattendants, he sang it before the monument of leonato\\'s family. when he\\nhad ended he said, “good night, hero. yearly will i do this.”\\n\\nhe then gravely, as became a gentleman whose heart was hero\\'s, made\\nready to marry a girl whom he did not love. he was told to meet her in\\nleonato\\'s house, and was faithful to his appointment.\\n\\nhe was shown into a room where antonio (leonato\\'s brother) and several\\nmasked ladies entered after him. friar francis, leonato, and benedick\\nwere present.\\n\\nantonio led one of the ladies towards claudio.\\n\\n“sweet,” said the young man, “let me see your face.”\\n\\n“swear first to marry her,” said leonato.\\n\\n“give me your hand,” said claudio to the lady; “before this holy friar i\\nswear to marry you if you will be my wife.”\\n\\n“alive i was your wife,” said the lady, as she drew off her mask.\\n\\n“another hero!” exclaimed claudio.\\n\\n“hero died,” explained leonato, “only while slander lived.”\\n\\nthe friar was then going to marry the reconciled pair, but benedick\\ninterrupted him with, “softly, friar; which of these ladies is\\nbeatrice?”\\n\\nhereat beatrice unmasked, and benedick said, “you love me, don\\'t you?”\\n\\n“only moderately,” was the reply. “do you love me?”\\n\\n“moderately,” answered benedick.\\n\\n“i was told you were well-nigh dead for me,” remarked beatrice.\\n\\n“of you i was told the same,” said benedick.\\n\\n“here\\'s your own hand in evidence of your love,” said claudio, producing\\na feeble sonnet which benedick had written to his sweetheart. “and\\nhere,” said hero, “is a tribute to benedick, which i picked out of the\\npocket of beatrice.”\\n\\n“a miracle!” exclaimed benedick. “our hands are against our hearts!\\ncome, i will marry you, beatrice.”\\n\\n“you shall be my husband to save your life,” was the rejoinder.\\n\\nbenedick kissed her on the mouth; and the friar married them after he\\nhad married claudio and hero.\\n\\n“how is benedick the married man?” asked don pedro.\\n\\n“too happy to be made unhappy,” replied benedick. “crack what jokes you\\nwill. as for you, claudio, i had hoped to run you through the body, but\\nas you are now my kinsman, live whole and love my cousin.”\\n\\n“my cudgel was in love with you, benedick, until to-day,” said claudio;\\nbut, “come, come, let\\'s dance,” said benedick.\\n\\nand dance they did. not even the news of the capture of don john was\\nable to stop the flying feet of the happy lovers, for revenge is not\\nsweet against an evil man who has failed to do harm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nromeo and juliet\\n\\n\\n\\nonce upon a time there lived in verona two great families named montagu\\nand capulet. they were both rich, and i suppose they were as sensible,\\nin most things, as other rich people. but in one thing they were\\nextremely silly. there was an old, old quarrel between the two families,\\nand instead of making it up like reasonable folks, they made a sort of\\npet of their quarrel, and would not let it die out. so that a montagu\\nwouldn\\'t speak to a capulet if he met one in the street--nor a capulet\\nto a montagu--or if they did speak, it was to say rude and unpleasant\\nthings, which often ended in a fight. and their relations and\\nservants were just as foolish, so that street fights and duels and\\nuncomfortablenesses of that kind were always growing out of the\\nmontagu-and-capulet quarrel.\\n\\nnow lord capulet, the head of that family, gave a party-- a grand supper\\nand a dance--and he was so hospitable that he said anyone might come to\\nit except (of course) the montagues. but there was a young montagu named\\nromeo, who very much wanted to be there, because rosaline, the lady he\\nloved, had been asked. this lady had never been at all kind to him, and\\nhe had no reason to love her; but the fact was that he wanted to love\\nsomebody, and as he hadn\\'t seen the right lady, he was obliged to love\\nthe wrong one. so to the capulet\\'s grand party he came, with his friends\\nmercutio and benvolio.\\n\\nold capulet welcomed him and his two friends very kindly--and young\\nromeo moved about among the crowd of courtly folk dressed in their\\nvelvets and satins, the men with jeweled sword hilts and collars, and\\nthe ladies with brilliant gems on breast and arms, and stones of price\\nset in their bright girdles. romeo was in his best too, and though he\\nwore a black mask over his eyes and nose, everyone could see by his\\nmouth and his hair, and the way he held his head, that he was twelve\\ntimes handsomer than anyone else in the room.\\n\\npresently amid the dancers he saw a lady so beautiful and so lovable\\nthat from that moment he never again gave one thought to that rosaline\\nwhom he had thought he loved. and he looked at this other fair lady, as\\nshe moved in the dance in her white satin and pearls, and all the world\\nseemed vain and worthless to him compared with her. and he was saying\\nthis, or something like it, when tybalt, lady capulet\\'s nephew, hearing\\nhis voice, knew him to be romeo. tybalt, being very angry, went at\\nonce to his uncle, and told him how a montagu had come uninvited to the\\nfeast; but old capulet was too fine a gentleman to be discourteous to\\nany man under his own roof, and he bade tybalt be quiet. but this young\\nman only waited for a chance to quarrel with romeo.\\n\\nin the meantime romeo made his way to the fair lady, and told her in\\nsweet words that he loved her, and kissed her. just then her mother sent\\nfor her, and then romeo found out that the lady on whom he had set his\\nheart\\'s hopes was juliet, the daughter of lord capulet, his sworn foe.\\nso he went away, sorrowing indeed, but loving her none the less.\\n\\nthen juliet said to her nurse:\\n\\n“who is that gentleman that would not dance?”\\n\\n“his name is romeo, and a montagu, the only son of your great enemy,”\\n answered the nurse.\\n\\nthen juliet went to her room, and looked out of her window, over the\\nbeautiful green-grey garden, where the moon was shining. and romeo was\\nhidden in that garden among the trees--because he could not bear to go\\nright away without trying to see her again. so she--not knowing him to\\nbe there--spoke her secret thought aloud, and told the quiet garden how\\nshe loved romeo.\\n\\nand romeo heard and was glad beyond measure. hidden below, he looked\\nup and saw her fair face in the moonlight, framed in the blossoming\\ncreepers that grew round her window, and as he looked and listened, he\\nfelt as though he had been carried away in a dream, and set down by some\\nmagician in that beautiful and enchanted garden.\\n\\n“ah--why are you called romeo?” said juliet. “since i love you, what\\ndoes it matter what you are called?”\\n\\n“call me but love, and i\\'ll be new baptized--henceforth i never will be\\nromeo,” he cried, stepping into the full white moonlight from the shade\\nof the cypresses and oleanders that had hidden him.\\n\\nshe was frightened at first, but when she saw that it was romeo himself,\\nand no stranger, she too was glad, and, he standing in the garden below\\nand she leaning from the window, they spoke long together, each one\\ntrying to find the sweetest words in the world, to make that pleasant\\ntalk that lovers use. and the tale of all they said, and the sweet music\\ntheir voices made together, is all set down in a golden book, where you\\nchildren may read it for yourselves some day.\\n\\nand the time passed so quickly, as it does for folk who love each other\\nand are together, that when the time came to part, it seemed as though\\nthey had met but that moment-- and indeed they hardly knew how to part.\\n\\n“i will send to you to-morrow,” said juliet.\\n\\nand so at last, with lingering and longing, they said good-bye.\\n\\njuliet went into her room, and a dark curtain bid her bright window.\\nromeo went away through the still and dewy garden like a man in a dream.\\n\\nthe next morning, very early, romeo went to friar laurence, a priest,\\nand, telling him all the story, begged him to marry him to juliet\\nwithout delay. and this, after some talk, the priest consented to do.\\n\\nso when juliet sent her old nurse to romeo that day to know what he\\npurposed to do, the old woman took back a a message that all was well,\\nand all things ready for the marriage of juliet and romeo on the next\\nmorning.\\n\\nthe young lovers were afraid to ask their parents\\' consent to their\\nmarriage, as young people should do, because of this foolish old quarrel\\nbetween the capulets and the montagues.\\n\\nand friar laurence was willing to help the young lovers secretly,\\nbecause he thought that when they were once married their parents\\nmight soon be told, and that the match might put a happy end to the old\\nquarrel.\\n\\nso the next morning early, romeo and juliet were married at friar\\nlaurence\\'s cell, and parted with tears and kisses. and romeo promised to\\ncome into the garden that evening, and the nurse got ready a rope-ladder\\nto let down from the window, so that romeo could climb up and talk to\\nhis dear wife quietly and alone.\\n\\nbut that very day a dreadful thing happened.\\n\\ntybalt, the young man who had been so vexed at romeo\\'s going to the\\ncapulet\\'s feast, met him and his two friends, mercutio and benvolio, in\\nthe street, called romeo a villain, and asked him to fight. romeo had no\\nwish to fight with juliet\\'s cousin, but mercutio drew his sword, and\\nhe and tybalt fought. and mercutio was killed. when romeo saw that this\\nfriend was dead, he forgot everything except anger at the man who had\\nkilled him, and he and tybalt fought till tybalt fell dead.\\n\\nso, on the very day of his wedding, romeo killed his dear juliet\\'s\\ncousin, and was sentenced to be banished. poor juliet and her young\\nhusband met that night indeed; he climbed the rope-ladder among the\\nflowers, and found her window, but their meeting was a sad one, and they\\nparted with bitter tears and hearts heavy, because they could not know\\nwhen they should meet again.\\n\\nnow juliet\\'s father, who, of course, had no idea that she was married,\\nwished her to wed a gentleman named paris, and was so angry when she\\nrefused, that she hurried away to ask friar laurence what she should do.\\nhe advised her to pretend to consent, and then he said:\\n\\n“i will give you a draught that will make you seem to be dead for two\\ndays, and then when they take you to church it will be to bury you, and\\nnot to marry you. they will put you in the vault thinking you are dead,\\nand before you wake up romeo and i will be there to take care of you.\\nwill you do this, or are you afraid?”\\n\\n“i will do it; talk not to me of fear!” said juliet. and she went home\\nand told her father she would marry paris. if she had spoken out and\\ntold her father the truth . . . well, then this would have been a\\ndifferent story.\\n\\nlord capulet was very much pleased to get his own way, and set about\\ninviting his friends and getting the wedding feast ready. everyone\\nstayed up all night, for there was a great deal to do, and very little\\ntime to do it in. lord capulet was anxious to get juliet married because\\nhe saw she was very unhappy. of course she was really fretting about her\\nhusband romeo, but her father thought she was grieving for the death of\\nher cousin tybalt, and he thought marriage would give her something else\\nto think about.\\n\\nearly in the morning the nurse came to call juliet, and to dress her\\nfor her wedding; but she would not wake, and at last the nurse cried out\\nsuddenly--\\n\\n“alas! alas! help! help! my lady\\'s dead! oh, well-a-day that ever i was\\nborn!”\\n\\nlady capulet came running in, and then lord capulet, and lord paris, the\\nbridegroom. there lay juliet cold and white and lifeless, and all their\\nweeping could not wake her. so it was a burying that day instead of a\\nmarrying. meantime friar laurence had sent a messenger to mantua with a\\nletter to romeo telling him of all these things; and all would have been\\nwell, only the messenger was delayed, and could not go.\\n\\nbut ill news travels fast. romeo\\'s servant who knew the secret of the\\nmarriage, but not of juliet\\'s pretended death, heard of her funeral, and\\nhurried to mantua to tell romeo how his young wife was dead and lying in\\nthe grave.\\n\\n“is it so?” cried romeo, heart-broken. “then i will lie by juliet\\'s side\\nto-night.”\\n\\nand he bought himself a poison, and went straight back to verona. he\\nhastened to the tomb where juliet was lying. it was not a grave, but a\\nvault. he broke open the door, and was just going down the stone steps\\nthat led to the vault where all the dead capulets lay, when he heard a\\nvoice behind him calling on him to stop.\\n\\nit was the count paris, who was to have married juliet that very day.\\n\\n“how dare you come here and disturb the dead bodies of the capulets, you\\nvile montagu?” cried paris.\\n\\npoor romeo, half mad with sorrow, yet tried to answer gently.\\n\\n“you were told,” said paris, “that if you returned to verona you must\\ndie.”\\n\\n“i must indeed,” said romeo. “i came here for nothing else. good, gentle\\nyouth--leave me! oh, go--before i do you any harm! i love you better\\nthan myself--go--leave me here--”\\n\\nthen paris said, “i defy you, and i arrest you as a felon,” and romeo,\\nin his anger and despair, drew his sword. they fought, and paris was\\nkilled.\\n\\nas romeo\\'s sword pierced him, paris cried--\\n\\n“oh, i am slain! if thou be merciful, open the tomb, and lay me with\\njuliet!”\\n\\nand romeo said, “in faith i will.”\\n\\nand he carried the dead man into the tomb and laid him by the dear\\njuliet\\'s side. then he kneeled by juliet and spoke to her, and held\\nher in his arms, and kissed her cold lips, believing that she was dead,\\nwhile all the while she was coming nearer and nearer to the time of her\\nawakening. then he drank the poison, and died beside his sweetheart and\\nwife.\\n\\nnow came friar laurence when it was too late, and saw all that had\\nhappened--and then poor juliet woke out of her sleep to find her husband\\nand her friend both dead beside her.\\n\\nthe noise of the fight had brought other folks to the place too, and\\nfriar laurence, hearing them, ran away, and juliet was left alone. she\\nsaw the cup that had held the poison, and knew how all had happened, and\\nsince no poison was left for her, she drew her romeo\\'s dagger and thrust\\nit through her heart--and so, falling with her head on her romeo\\'s\\nbreast, she died. and here ends the story of these faithful and most\\nunhappy lovers.\\n\\n            *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\nand when the old folks knew from friar laurence of all that had\\nbefallen, they sorrowed exceedingly, and now, seeing all the mischief\\ntheir wicked quarrel had wrought, they repented them of it, and over the\\nbodies of their dead children they clasped hands at last, in friendship\\nand forgiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npericles\\n\\n\\n\\npericles, the prince of tyre, was unfortunate enough to make an enemy of\\nantiochus, the powerful and wicked king of antioch; and so great was the\\ndanger in which he stood that, on the advice of his trusty counselor,\\nlord helicanus, he determined to travel about the world for a time. he\\ncame to this decision despite the fact that, by the death of his father,\\nhe was now king of tyre. so he set sail for tarsus, appointing helicanus\\nregent during his absence. that he did wisely in thus leaving his\\nkingdom was soon made clear.\\n\\nhardly had he sailed on his voyage, when lord thaliard arrived from\\nantioch with instructions from his royal master to kill pericles. the\\nfaithful helicanus soon discovered the deadly purpose of this wicked\\nlord, and at once sent messengers to tarsus to warn the king of the\\ndanger which threatened him.\\n\\nthe people of tarsus were in such poverty and distress that pericles,\\nfeeling that he could find no safe refuge there, put to sea again. but\\na dreadful storm overtook the ship in which he was, and the good vessel\\nwas wrecked, while of all on board only pericles was saved. bruised\\nand wet and faint, he was flung upon the cruel rocks on the coast of\\npentapolis, the country of the good king simonides. worn out as he was,\\nhe looked for nothing but death, and that speedily. but some fishermen,\\ncoming down to the beach, found him there, and gave him clothes and bade\\nhim be of good cheer.\\n\\n“thou shalt come home with me,” said one of them, “and we will have\\nflesh for holidays, fish for fasting days, and moreo\\'er, puddings and\\nflapjacks, and thou shalt be welcome.”\\n\\nthey told him that on the morrow many princes and knights were going\\nto the king\\'s court, there to joust and tourney for the love of his\\ndaughter, the beautiful princess thaisa.\\n\\n“did but my fortunes equal my desires,” said pericles, “i\\'d wish to make\\none there.”\\n\\nas he spoke, some of the fishermen came by, drawing their net, and it\\ndragged heavily, resisting all their efforts, but at last they hauled it\\nin, to find that it contained a suit of rusty armor; and looking at it,\\nhe blessed fortune for her kindness, for he saw that it was his own,\\nwhich had been given to him by his dead father. he begged the fishermen\\nto let him have it that he might go to court and take part in the\\ntournament, promising that if ever his ill fortunes bettered, he would\\nreward them well. the fishermen readily consented, and being thus fully\\nequipped, pericles set off in his rusty armor to the king\\'s court.\\n\\nin the tournament none bore himself so well as pericles, and he won the\\nwreath of victory, which the fair princess herself placed on his brows.\\nthen at her father\\'s command she asked him who he was, and whence he\\ncame; and he answered that he was a knight of tyre, by name pericles,\\nbut he did not tell her that he was the king of that country, for he\\nknew that if once his whereabouts became known to antiochus, his life\\nwould not be worth a pin\\'s purchase.\\n\\nnevertheless thaisa loved him dearly, and the king was so pleased with\\nhis courage and graceful bearing that he gladly permitted his daughter\\nto have her own way, when she told him she would marry the stranger\\nknight or die.\\n\\nthus pericles became the husband of the fair lady for whose sake he\\nhad striven with the knights who came in all their bravery to joust and\\ntourney for her love.\\n\\nmeanwhile the wicked king antiochus had died, and the people in tyre,\\nhearing no news of their king, urged lord helicanus to ascend the vacant\\nthrone. but they could only get him to promise that he would become\\ntheir king, if at the end of a year pericles did not come back.\\nmoreover, he sent forth messengers far and wide in search of the missing\\npericles.\\n\\nsome of these made their way to pentapolis, and finding their king\\nthere, told him how discontented his people were at his long absence,\\nand that, antiochus being dead, there was nothing now to hinder him from\\nreturning to his kingdom. then pericles told his wife and father-in-law\\nwho he really was, and they and all the subjects of simonides greatly\\nrejoiced to know that the gallant husband of thaisa was a king in his\\nown right. so pericles set sail with his dear wife for his native land.\\nbut once more the sea was cruel to him, for again a dreadful storm broke\\nout, and while it was at its height, a servant came to tell him that\\na little daughter was born to him. this news would have made his heart\\nglad indeed, but that the servant went on to add that his wife--his\\ndear, dear thaisa--was dead.\\n\\nwhile he was praying the gods to be good to his little baby girl,\\nthe sailors came to him, declaring that the dead queen must be thrown\\noverboard, for they believed that the storm would never cease so long\\nas a dead body remained in the vessel. so thaisa was laid in a big chest\\nwith spices and jewels, and a scroll on which the sorrowful king wrote\\nthese lines:\\n\\n   “here i give to understand\\n    (if e\\'er this coffin drive a-land),\\n    i, king pericles, have lost\\n    this queen worth all our mundane cost.\\n    who finds her, give her burying;\\n    she was the daughter of a king;\\n    besides this treasure for a fee,\\n    the gods requite his charity!”\\n\\nthen the chest was cast into the sea, and the waves taking it, by and\\nby washed it ashore at ephesus, where it was found by the servants of a\\nlord named cerimon. he at once ordered it to be opened, and when he\\nsaw how lovely thaisa looked, he doubted if she were dead, and took\\nimmediate steps to restore her. then a great wonder happened, for she,\\nwho had been thrown into the sea as dead, came back to life. but feeling\\nsure that she would never see her husband again, thaisa retired from the\\nworld, and became a priestess of the goddess diana.\\n\\nwhile these things were happening, pericles went on to tarsus with his\\nlittle daughter, whom he called marina, because she had been born at\\nsea. leaving her in the hands of his old friend the governor of tarsus,\\nthe king sailed for his own dominions.\\n\\nnow dionyza, the wife of the governor of tarsus, was a jealous and\\nwicked woman, and finding that the young princess grew up a more\\naccomplished and charming girl than her own daughter, she determined to\\ntake marina\\'s life. so when marina was fourteen, dionyza ordered one of\\nher servants to take her away and kill her. this villain would have done\\nso, but that he was interrupted by some pirates who came in and carried\\nmarina off to sea with them, and took her to mitylene, where they sold\\nher as a slave. yet such was her goodness, her grace, and her beauty,\\nthat she soon became honored there, and lysimachus, the young governor,\\nfell deep in love with her, and would have married her, but that he\\nthought she must be of too humble parentage to become the wife of one in\\nhis high position.\\n\\nthe wicked dionyza believed, from her servant\\'s report, that marina was\\nreally dead, and so she put up a monument to her memory, and showed it\\nto king pericles, when after long years of absence he came to see\\nhis much-loved child. when he heard that she was dead, his grief was\\nterrible to see. he set sail once more, and putting on sackcloth, vowed\\nnever to wash his face or cut his hair again. there was a pavilion\\nerected on deck, and there he lay alone, and for three months he spoke\\nword to none.\\n\\nat last it chanced that his ship came into the port of mitylene, and\\nlysimachus, the governor, went on board to enquire whence the vessel\\ncame. when he heard the story of pericles\\' sorrow and silence, he\\nbethought him of marina, and believing that she could rouse the king\\nfrom his stupor, sent for her and bade her try her utmost to persuade\\nthe king to speak, promising whatever reward she would, if she\\nsucceeded. marina gladly obeyed, and sending the rest away, she sat and\\nsang to her poor grief-laden father, yet, sweet as was her voice, he\\nmade no sign. so presently she spoke to him, saying that her grief might\\nequal his, for, though she was a slave, she came from ancestors that\\nstood equal to mighty kings.\\n\\nsomething in her voice and story touched the king\\'s heart, and he looked\\nup at her, and as he looked, he saw with wonder how like she was to his\\nlost wife, so with a great hope springing up in his heart, he bade her\\ntell her story.\\n\\nthen, with many interruptions from the king, she told him who she was\\nand how she had escaped from the cruel dionyza. so pericles knew that\\nthis was indeed his daughter, and he kissed her again and again, crying\\nthat his great seas of joy drowned him with their sweetness. “give me my\\nrobes,” he said: “o heaven, bless my girl!”\\n\\nthen there came to him, though none else could hear it, the sound of\\nheavenly music, and falling asleep, he beheld the goddess diana, in a\\nvision.\\n\\n“go,” she said to him, “to my temple at ephesus, and when my maiden\\npriests are met together, reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife.”\\n\\npericles obeyed the goddess and told his tale before her altar. hardly\\nhad he made an end, when the chief priestess, crying out, “you are--you\\nare--o royal pericles!” fell fainting to the ground, and presently\\nrecovering, she spoke again to him, “o my lord, are you not pericles?”\\n “the voice of dead thaisa!” exclaimed the king in wonder. “that thaisa\\nam i,” she said, and looking at her he saw that she spoke the very\\ntruth.\\n\\nthus pericles and thaisa, after long and bitter suffering, found\\nhappiness once more, and in the joy of their meeting they forgot the\\npain of the past. to marina great happiness was given, and not only\\nin being restored to her dear parents; for she married lysimachus, and\\nbecame a princess in the land where she had been sold as a slave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhamlet\\n\\n\\n\\nhamlet was the only son of the king of denmark. he loved his father and\\nmother dearly--and was happy in the love of a sweet lady named ophelia.\\nher father, polonius, was the king\\'s chamberlain.\\n\\nwhile hamlet was away studying at wittenberg, his father died. young\\nhamlet hastened home in great grief to hear that a serpent had stung\\nthe king, and that he was dead. the young prince had loved his father so\\ntenderly that you may judge what he felt when he found that the queen,\\nbefore yet the king had been laid in the ground a month, had determined\\nto marry again--and to marry the dead king\\'s brother.\\n\\nhamlet refused to put off mourning for the wedding.\\n\\n“it is not only the black i wear on my body,” he said, “that proves my\\nloss. i wear mourning in my heart for my dead father. his son at least\\nremembers him, and grieves still.”\\n\\nthen said claudius the king\\'s brother, “this grief is unreasonable. of\\ncourse you must sorrow at the loss of your father, but--”\\n\\n“ah,” said hamlet, bitterly, “i cannot in one little month forget those\\ni love.”\\n\\nwith that the queen and claudius left him, to make merry over their\\nwedding, forgetting the poor good king who had been so kind to them\\nboth.\\n\\nand hamlet, left alone, began to wonder and to question as to what he\\nought to do. for he could not believe the story about the snake-bite.\\nit seemed to him all too plain that the wicked claudius had killed the\\nking, so as to get the crown and marry the queen. yet he had no proof,\\nand could not accuse claudius.\\n\\nand while he was thus thinking came horatio, a fellow student of his,\\nfrom wittenberg.\\n\\n“what brought you here?” asked hamlet, when he had greeted his friend\\nkindly.\\n\\n“i came, my lord, to see your father\\'s funeral.”\\n\\n“i think it was to see my mother\\'s wedding,” said hamlet, bitterly. “my\\nfather! we shall not look upon his like again.”\\n\\n“my lord,” answered horatio, “i think i saw him yesternight.”\\n\\nthen, while hamlet listened in surprise, horatio told how he, with two\\ngentlemen of the guard, had seen the king\\'s ghost on the battlements.\\nhamlet went that night, and true enough, at midnight, the ghost of the\\nking, in the armor he had been wont to wear, appeared on the battlements\\nin the chill moonlight. hamlet was a brave youth. instead of running\\naway from the ghost he spoke to it--and when it beckoned him he followed\\nit to a quiet place, and there the ghost told him that what he had\\nsuspected was true. the wicked claudius had indeed killed his good\\nbrother the king, by dropping poison into his ear as he slept in his\\norchard in the afternoon.\\n\\n“and you,” said the ghost, “must avenge this cruel murder-- on my wicked\\nbrother. but do nothing against the queen-- for i have loved her, and\\nshe is your mother. remember me.”\\n\\nthen seeing the morning approach, the ghost vanished.\\n\\n“now,” said hamlet, “there is nothing left but revenge. remember thee--i\\nwill remember nothing else--books, pleasure, youth--let all go--and your\\ncommands alone live on my brain.”\\n\\nso when his friends came back he made them swear to keep the secret of\\nthe ghost, and then went in from the battlements, now gray with mingled\\ndawn and moonlight, to think how he might best avenge his murdered\\nfather.\\n\\nthe shock of seeing and hearing his father\\'s ghost made him feel almost\\nmad, and for fear that his uncle might notice that he was not himself,\\nhe determined to hide his mad longing for revenge under a pretended\\nmadness in other matters.\\n\\nand when he met ophelia, who loved him--and to whom he had given gifts,\\nand letters, and many loving words--he behaved so wildly to her, that\\nshe could not but think him mad. for she loved him so that she could not\\nbelieve he would be as cruel as this, unless he were quite mad. so she\\ntold her father, and showed him a pretty letter from hamlet. and in the\\nletter was much folly, and this pretty verse--\\n\\n       “doubt that the stars are fire;\\n          doubt that the sun doth move;\\n        doubt truth to be a liar;\\n          but never doubt i love.”\\n\\nand from that time everyone believed that the cause of hamlet\\'s supposed\\nmadness was love.\\n\\npoor hamlet was very unhappy. he longed to obey his father\\'s ghost--and\\nyet he was too gentle and kindly to wish to kill another man, even his\\nfather\\'s murderer. and sometimes he wondered whether, after all, the\\nghost spoke truly.\\n\\njust at this time some actors came to the court, and hamlet ordered them\\nto perform a certain play before the king and queen. now, this play\\nwas the story of a man who had been murdered in his garden by a near\\nrelation, who afterwards married the dead man\\'s wife.\\n\\nyou may imagine the feelings of the wicked king, as he sat on his\\nthrone, with the queen beside him and all his court around, and saw,\\nacted on the stage, the very wickedness that he had himself done. and\\nwhen, in the play, the wicked relation poured poison into the ear of the\\nsleeping man, the wicked claudius suddenly rose, and staggered from the\\nroom--the queen and others following.\\n\\nthen said hamlet to his friends--\\n\\n“now i am sure the ghost spoke true. for if claudius had not done this\\nmurder, he could not have been so distressed to see it in a play.”\\n\\nnow the queen sent for hamlet, by the king\\'s desire, to scold him\\nfor his conduct during the play, and for other matters; and claudius,\\nwishing to know exactly what happened, told old polonius to hide himself\\nbehind the hangings in the queen\\'s room. and as they talked, the queen\\ngot frightened at hamlet\\'s rough, strange words, and cried for help, and\\npolonius behind the curtain cried out too. hamlet, thinking it was the\\nking who was hidden there, thrust with his sword at the hangings, and\\nkilled, not the king, but poor old polonius.\\n\\nso now hamlet had offended his uncle and his mother, and by bad hap\\nkilled his true love\\'s father.\\n\\n“oh! what a rash and bloody deed is this,” cried the queen.\\n\\nand hamlet answered bitterly, “almost as bad as to kill a king, and\\nmarry his brother.” then hamlet told the queen plainly all his thoughts\\nand how he knew of the murder, and begged her, at least, to have no more\\nfriendship or kindness of the base claudius, who had killed the good\\nking. and as they spoke the king\\'s ghost again appeared before hamlet,\\nbut the queen could not see it. so when the ghost had gone, they parted.\\n\\nwhen the queen told claudius what had passed, and how polonius was dead,\\nhe said, “this shows plainly that hamlet is mad, and since he has killed\\nthe chancellor, it is for his own safety that we must carry out our\\nplan, and send him away to england.”\\n\\nso hamlet was sent, under charge of two courtiers who served the king,\\nand these bore letters to the english court, requiring that hamlet\\nshould be put to death. but hamlet had the good sense to get at these\\nletters, and put in others instead, with the names of the two courtiers\\nwho were so ready to betray him. then, as the vessel went to england,\\nhamlet escaped on board a pirate ship, and the two wicked courtiers left\\nhim to his fate, and went on to meet theirs.\\n\\nhamlet hurried home, but in the meantime a dreadful thing had happened.\\npoor pretty ophelia, having lost her lover and her father, lost her wits\\ntoo, and went in sad madness about the court, with straws, and weeds,\\nand flowers in her hair, singing strange scraps of songs, and talking\\npoor, foolish, pretty talk with no heart of meaning to it. and one\\nday, coming to a stream where willows grew, she tried to bang a flowery\\ngarland on a willow, and fell into the water with all her flowers, and\\nso died.\\n\\nand hamlet had loved her, though his plan of seeming madness had made\\nhim hide it; and when he came back, he found the king and queen, and the\\ncourt, weeping at the funeral of his dear love and lady.\\n\\nophelia\\'s brother, laertes, had also just come to court to ask justice\\nfor the death of his father, old polonius; and now, wild with grief, he\\nleaped into his sister\\'s grave, to clasp her in his arms once more.\\n\\n“i loved her more than forty thousand brothers,” cried hamlet, and leapt\\ninto the grave after him, and they fought till they were parted.\\n\\nafterwards hamlet begged laertes to forgive him.\\n\\n“i could not bear,” he said, “that any, even a brother, should seem to\\nlove her more than i.”\\n\\nbut the wicked claudius would not let them be friends. he told laertes\\nhow hamlet had killed old polonius, and between them they made a plot to\\nslay hamlet by treachery.\\n\\nlaertes challenged him to a fencing match, and all the court were\\npresent. hamlet had the blunt foil always used in fencing, but laertes\\nhad prepared for himself a sword, sharp, and tipped with poison. and the\\nwicked king had made ready a bowl of poisoned wine, which he meant\\nto give poor hamlet when he should grow warm with the sword play, and\\nshould call for drink.\\n\\nso laertes and hamlet fought, and laertes, after some fencing, gave\\nhamlet a sharp sword thrust. hamlet, angry at this treachery--for\\nthey had been fencing, not as men fight, but as they play--closed with\\nlaertes in a struggle; both dropped their swords, and when they picked\\nthem up again, hamlet, without noticing it, had exchanged his own blunt\\nsword for laertes\\' sharp and poisoned one. and with one thrust of it he\\npierced laertes, who fell dead by his own treachery.\\n\\nat this moment the queen cried out, “the drink, the drink! oh, my dear\\nhamlet! i am poisoned!”\\n\\nshe had drunk of the poisoned bowl the king had prepared for hamlet, and\\nthe king saw the queen, whom, wicked as he was, he really loved, fall\\ndead by his means.\\n\\nthen ophelia being dead, and polonius, and the queen, and laertes, and\\nthe two courtiers who had been sent to england, hamlet at last found\\ncourage to do the ghost\\'s bidding and avenge his father\\'s murder--which,\\nif he had braced up his heart to do long before, all these lives\\nhad been spared, and none had suffered but the wicked king, who well\\ndeserved to die.\\n\\nhamlet, his heart at last being great enough to do the deed he ought,\\nturned the poisoned sword on the false king.\\n\\n“then--venom--do thy work!” he cried, and the king died.\\n\\nso hamlet in the end kept the promise he had made his father. and all\\nbeing now accomplished, he himself died. and those who stood by saw him\\ndie, with prayers and tears, for his friends and his people loved him\\nwith their whole hearts. thus ends the tragic tale of hamlet, prince of\\ndenmark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncymbeline\\n\\n\\n\\ncymbeline was the king of britain. he had three children. the two sons\\nwere stolen away from him when they were quite little children, and he\\nwas left with only one daughter, imogen. the king married a second\\ntime, and brought up leonatus, the son of a dear friend, as imogen\\'s\\nplayfellow; and when leonatus was old enough, imogen secretly married\\nhim. this made the king and queen very angry, and the king, to punish\\nleonatus, banished him from britain.\\n\\npoor imogen was nearly heart-broken at parting from leonatus, and he was\\nnot less unhappy. for they were not only lovers and husband and wife,\\nbut they had been friends and comrades ever since they were quite little\\nchildren. with many tears and kisses they said “good-bye.” they promised\\nnever to forget each other, and that they would never care for anyone\\nelse as long as they lived.\\n\\n“this diamond was my mother\\'s, love,” said imogen; “take it, my heart,\\nand keep it as long as you love me.”\\n\\n“sweetest, fairest,” answered leonatus, “wear this bracelet for my\\nsake.”\\n\\n“ah!” cried imogen, weeping, “when shall we meet again?”\\n\\nand while they were still in each other\\'s arms, the king came in, and\\nleonatus had to leave without more farewell.\\n\\nwhen he was come to rome, where he had gone to stay with an old friend\\nof his father\\'s, he spent his days still in thinking of his dear imogen,\\nand his nights in dreaming of her. one day at a feast some italian and\\nfrench noblemen were talking of their sweethearts, and swearing that\\nthey were the most faithful and honorable and beautiful ladies in the\\nworld. and a frenchman reminded leonatus how he had said many times that\\nhis wife imogen was more fair, wise, and constant than any of the ladies\\nin france.\\n\\n“i say so still,” said leonatus.\\n\\n“she is not so good but that she would deceive,” said iachimo, one of\\nthe italian nobles.\\n\\n“she never would deceive,” said leonatus.\\n\\n“i wager,” said iachimo, “that, if i go to britain, i can persuade your\\nwife to do whatever i wish, even if it should be against your wishes.”\\n\\n“that you will never do,” said leonatus. “i wager this ring upon my\\nfinger,” which was the very ring imogen had given him at parting, “that\\nmy wife will keep all her vows to me, and that you will never persuade\\nher to do otherwise.”\\n\\nso iachimo wagered half his estate against the ring on leonatus\\'s\\nfinger, and started forthwith for britain, with a letter of introduction\\nto leonatus\\'s wife. when he reached there he was received with all\\nkindness; but he was still determined to win his wager.\\n\\nhe told imogen that her husband thought no more of her, and went on to\\ntell many cruel lies about him. imogen listened at first, but presently\\nperceived what a wicked person iachimo was, and ordered him to leave\\nher. then he said--\\n\\n“pardon me, fair lady, all that i have said is untrue. i only told you\\nthis to see whether you would believe me, or whether you were as much to\\nbe trusted as your husband thinks. will you forgive me?”\\n\\n“i forgive you freely,” said imogen.\\n\\n“then,” went on iachimo, “perhaps you will prove it by taking charge of\\na trunk, containing a number of jewels which your husband and i and some\\nother gentlemen have bought as a present for the emperor of rome.”\\n\\n“i will indeed,” said imogen, “do anything for my husband and a friend\\nof my husband\\'s. have the jewels sent into my room, and i will take care\\nof them.”\\n\\n“it is only for one night,” said iachimo, “for i leave britain again\\nto-morrow.”\\n\\nso the trunk was carried into imogen\\'s room, and that night she went to\\nbed and to sleep. when she was fast asleep, the lid of the trunk opened\\nand a man got out. it was iachimo. the story about the jewels was as\\nuntrue as the rest of the things he had said. he had only wished to get\\ninto her room to win his wicked wager. he looked about him and noticed\\nthe furniture, and then crept to the side of the bed where imogen\\nwas asleep and took from her arm the gold bracelet which had been the\\nparting gift of her husband. then he crept back to the trunk, and next\\nmorning sailed for rome.\\n\\nwhen he met leonatus, he said--\\n\\n“i have been to britain and i have won the wager, for your wife no\\nlonger thinks about you. she stayed talking with me all one night in her\\nroom, which is hung with tapestry and has a carved chimney-piece, and\\nsilver andirons in the shape of two winking cupids.”\\n\\n“i do not believe she has forgotten me; i do not believe she stayed\\ntalking with you in her room. you have heard her room described by the\\nservants.”\\n\\n“ah!” said iachimo, “but she gave me this bracelet. she took it from\\nher arm. i see her yet. her pretty action did outsell her gift, and yet\\nenriched it too. she gave it me, and said she prized it once.”\\n\\n“take the ring,” cried leonatus, “you have won; and you might have\\nwon my life as well, for i care nothing for it now i know my lady has\\nforgotten me.”\\n\\nand mad with anger, he wrote letters to britain to his old servant,\\npisanio, ordering him to take imogen to milford haven, and to murder\\nher, because she had forgotten him and given away his gift. at the same\\ntime he wrote to imogen herself, telling her to go with pisanio, his old\\nservant, to milford haven, and that he, her husband, would be there to\\nmeet her.\\n\\nnow when pisanio got this letter he was too good to carry out its\\norders, and too wise to let them alone altogether. so he gave imogen the\\nletter from her husband, and started with her for milford haven. before\\nhe left, the wicked queen gave him a drink which, she said, would be\\nuseful in sickness. she hoped he would give it to imogen, and that\\nimogen would die, and the wicked queen\\'s son could be king. for the\\nqueen thought this drink was a poison, but really and truly it was only\\na sleeping-draft.\\n\\nwhen pisanio and imogen came near to milford haven, he told her what was\\nreally in the letter he had had from her husband.\\n\\n“i must go on to rome, and see him myself,” said imogen.\\n\\nand then pisanio helped her to dress in boy\\'s clothes, and sent her\\non her way, and went back to the court. before he went he gave her the\\ndrink he had had from the queen.\\n\\nimogen went on, getting more and more tired, and at last came to a cave.\\nsomeone seemed to live there, but no one was in just then. so she went\\nin, and as she was almost dying of hunger, she took some food she saw\\nthere, and had just done so, when an old man and two boys came into the\\ncave. she was very much frightened when she saw them, for she thought\\nthat they would be angry with her for taking their food, though she\\nhad meant to leave money for it on the table. but to her surprise they\\nwelcomed her kindly. she looked very pretty in her boy\\'s clothes and her\\nface was good, as well as pretty.\\n\\n“you shall be our brother,” said both the boys; and so she stayed with\\nthem, and helped to cook the food, and make things comfortable. but one\\nday when the old man, whose name was bellarius, was out hunting with\\nthe two boys, imogen felt ill, and thought she would try the medicine\\npisanio had given her. so she took it, and at once became like a dead\\ncreature, so that when bellarius and the boys came back from hunting,\\nthey thought she was dead, and with many tears and funeral songs, they\\ncarried her away and laid her in the wood, covered with flowers.\\n\\nthey sang sweet songs to her, and strewed flowers on her, pale\\nprimroses, and the azure harebell, and eglantine, and furred moss, and\\nwent away sorrowful. no sooner had they gone than imogen awoke, and not\\nknowing how she came there, nor where she was, went wandering through\\nthe wood.\\n\\nnow while imogen had been living in the cave, the romans had decided to\\nattack britain, and their army had come over, and with them leonatus,\\nwho had grown sorry for his wickedness against imogen, so had come\\nback, not to fight with the romans against britain, but with the britons\\nagainst rome. so as imogen wandered alone, she met with lucius, the\\nroman general, and took service with him as his page.\\n\\nwhen the battle was fought between the romans and britons, bellarius and\\nhis two boys fought for their own country, and leonatus, disguised as\\na british peasant, fought beside them. the romans had taken cymbeline\\nprisoner, and old bellarius, with his sons and leonatus, bravely rescued\\nthe king. then the britons won the battle, and among the prisoners\\nbrought before the king were lucius, with imogen, iachimo, and leonatus,\\nwho had put on the uniform of a roman soldier. he was tired of his life\\nsince he had cruelly ordered his wife to be killed, and he hoped that,\\nas a roman soldier, he would be put to death.\\n\\nwhen they were brought before the king, lucius spoke out--\\n\\n“a roman with a roman\\'s heart can suffer,” he said. “if i must die, so\\nbe it. this one thing only will i entreat. my boy, a briton born, let\\nhim be ransomed. never master had a page so kind, so duteous, diligent,\\ntrue. he has done no briton harm, though he has served a roman. save\\nhim, sir.”\\n\\nthen cymbeline looked on the page, who was his own daughter, imogen, in\\ndisguise, and though he did not recognize her, he felt such a kindness\\nthat he not only spared the boy\\'s life, but he said--\\n\\n“he shall have any boon he likes to ask of me, even though he ask a\\nprisoner, the noblest taken.”\\n\\nthen imogen said, “the boon i ask is that this gentleman shall say from\\nwhom he got the ring he has on his finger,” and she pointed to iachimo.\\n\\n“speak,” said cymbeline, “how did you get that diamond?”\\n\\nthen iachimo told the whole truth of his villainy. at this, leonatus was\\nunable to contain himself, and casting aside all thought of disguise, he\\ncame forward, cursing himself for his folly in having believed iachimo\\'s\\nlying story, and calling again and again on his wife whom he believed\\ndead.\\n\\n“oh, imogen, my love, my life!” he cried. “oh, imogen!\\n\\nthen imogen, forgetting she was disguised, cried out, “peace, my\\nlord--here, here!”\\n\\nleonatus turned to strike the forward page who thus interfered in his\\ngreat trouble, and then he saw that it was his wife, imogen, and they\\nfell into each other\\'s arms.\\n\\nthe king was so glad to see his dear daughter again, and so grateful to\\nthe man who had rescued him (whom he now found to be leonatus), that he\\ngave his blessing on their marriage, and then he turned to bellarius,\\nand the two boys. now bellarius spoke--\\n\\n“i am your old servant, bellarius. you accused me of treason when i had\\nonly been loyal to you, and to be doubted, made me disloyal. so i stole\\nyour two sons, and see,--they are here!” and he brought forward the two\\nboys, who had sworn to be brothers to imogen when they thought she was a\\nboy like themselves.\\n\\nthe wicked queen was dead of some of her own poisons, and the king, with\\nhis three children about him, lived to a happy old age.\\n\\nso the wicked were punished, and the good and true lived happy ever\\nafter. so may the wicked suffer, and honest folk prosper till the\\nworld\\'s end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmacbeth\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen a person is asked to tell the story of macbeth, he can tell two\\nstories. one is of a man called macbeth who came to the throne of\\nscotland by a crime in the year of our lord 1039, and reigned justly\\nand well, on the whole, for fifteen years or more. this story is part\\nof scottish history. the other story issues from a place called\\nimagination; it is gloomy and wonderful, and you shall hear it.\\n\\na year or two before edward the confessor began to rule england, a\\nbattle was won in scotland against a norwegian king by two generals\\nnamed macbeth and banquo. after the battle, the generals walked together\\ntowards forres, in elginshire, where duncan, king of scotland, was\\nawaiting them.\\n\\nwhile they were crossing a lonely heath, they saw three bearded women,\\nsisters, hand in hand, withered in appearance and wild in their attire.\\n\\n“speak, who are you?” demanded macbeth.\\n\\n“hail, macbeth, chieftain of glamis,” said the first woman.\\n\\n“hail, macbeth, chieftain of cawdor,” said the second woman.\\n\\n“hail, macbeth, king that is to be,” said the third woman.\\n\\nthen banquo asked, “what of me?” and the third woman replied, “thou\\nshalt be the father of kings.”\\n\\n“tell me more,” said macbeth. “by my father\\'s death i am chieftain of\\nglamis, but the chieftain of cawdor lives, and the king lives, and his\\nchildren live. speak, i charge you!”\\n\\nthe women replied only by vanishing, as though suddenly mixed with the\\nair.\\n\\nbanquo and macbeth knew then that they had been addressed by witches,\\nand were discussing their prophecies when two nobles approached. one of\\nthem thanked macbeth, in the king\\'s name, for his military services, and\\nthe other said, “he bade me call you chieftain of cawdor.”\\n\\nmacbeth then learned that the man who had yesterday borne that title\\nwas to die for treason, and he could not help thinking, “the third witch\\ncalled me, \\'king that is to be.\\'”\\n\\n“banquo,” he said, “you see that the witches spoke truth concerning me.\\ndo you not believe, therefore, that your child and grandchild will be\\nkings?”\\n\\nbanquo frowned. duncan had two sons, malcolm and donalbain, and he\\ndeemed it disloyal to hope that his son fleance should rule scotland.\\nhe told macbeth that the witches might have intended to tempt them\\nboth into villainy by their prophecies concerning the throne. macbeth,\\nhowever, thought the prophecy that he should be king too pleasant to\\nkeep to himself, and he mentioned it to his wife in a letter.\\n\\nlady macbeth was the grand-daughter of a king of scotland who had died\\nin defending his crown against the king who preceded duncan, and by\\nwhose order her only brother was slain. to her, duncan was a reminder\\nof bitter wrongs. her husband had royal blood in his veins, and when she\\nread his letter, she was determined that he should be king.\\n\\nwhen a messenger arrived to inform her that duncan would pass a night in\\nmacbeth\\'s castle, she nerved herself for a very base action.\\n\\nshe told macbeth almost as soon as she saw him that duncan must spend\\na sunless morrow. she meant that duncan must die, and that the dead are\\nblind. “we will speak further,” said macbeth uneasily, and at night,\\nwith his memory full of duncan\\'s kind words, he would fain have spared\\nhis guest.\\n\\n“would you live a coward?” demanded lady macbeth, who seems to have\\nthought that morality and cowardice were the same.\\n\\n“i dare do all that may become a man,” replied macbeth; “who dare do\\nmore is none.”\\n\\n“why did you write that letter to me?” she inquired fiercely, and with\\nbitter words she egged him on to murder, and with cunning words she\\nshowed him how to do it.\\n\\nafter supper duncan went to bed, and two grooms were placed on guard at\\nhis bedroom door. lady macbeth caused them to drink wine till they were\\nstupefied. she then took their daggers and would have killed the king\\nherself if his sleeping face had not looked like her father\\'s.\\n\\nmacbeth came later, and found the daggers lying by the grooms; and soon\\nwith red hands he appeared before his wife, saying, “methought i heard a\\nvoice cry, \\'sleep no more! macbeth destroys the sleeping.\\'”\\n\\n“wash your hands,” said she. “why did you not leave the daggers by the\\ngrooms? take them back, and smear the grooms with blood.”\\n\\n“i dare not,” said macbeth.\\n\\nhis wife dared, and she returned to him with hands red as his own, but a\\nheart less white, she proudly told him, for she scorned his fear.\\n\\nthe murderers heard a knocking, and macbeth wished it was a knocking\\nwhich could wake the dead. it was the knocking of macduff, the chieftain\\nof fife, who had been told by duncan to visit him early. macbeth went to\\nhim, and showed him the door of the king\\'s room.\\n\\nmacduff entered, and came out again crying, “o horror! horror! horror!”\\n\\nmacbeth appeared as horror-stricken as macduff, and pretending that he\\ncould not bear to see life in duncan\\'s murderers, he slew the two grooms\\nwith their own daggers before they could proclaim their innocence.\\n\\nthese murders did not shriek out, and macbeth was crowned at scone.\\none of duncan\\'s sons went to ireland, the other to england. macbeth was\\nking. but he was discontented. the prophecy concerning banquo oppressed\\nhis mind. if fleance were to rule, a son of macbeth would not rule.\\nmacbeth determined, therefore, to murder both banquo and his son. he\\nhired two ruffians, who slew banquo one night when he was on his way\\nwith fleance to a banquet which macbeth was giving to his nobles.\\nfleance escaped.\\n\\nmeanwhile macbeth and his queen received their guests very graciously,\\nand he expressed a wish for them which has been uttered thousands of\\ntimes since his day--“now good digestion wait on appetite, and health on\\nboth.”\\n\\n“we pray your majesty to sit with us,” said lennox, a scotch noble; but\\nere macbeth could reply, the ghost of banquo entered the banqueting hall\\nand sat in macbeth\\'s place.\\n\\nnot noticing the ghost, macbeth observed that, if banquo were present,\\nhe could say that he had collected under his roof the choicest chivalry\\nof scotland. macduff, however, had curtly declined his invitation.\\n\\nthe king was again pressed to take a seat, and lennox, to whom banquo\\'s\\nghost was invisible, showed him the chair where it sat.\\n\\nbut macbeth, with his eyes of genius, saw the ghost. he saw it like a\\nform of mist and blood, and he demanded passionately, “which of you have\\ndone this?”\\n\\nstill none saw the ghost but he, and to the ghost macbeth said, “thou\\ncanst not say i did it.”\\n\\nthe ghost glided out, and macbeth was impudent enough to raise a glass\\nof wine “to the general joy of the whole table, and to our dear friend\\nbanquo, whom we miss.”\\n\\nthe toast was drunk as the ghost of banquo entered for the second time.\\n\\n“begone!” cried macbeth. “you are senseless, mindless! hide in the\\nearth, thou horrible shadow.”\\n\\nagain none saw the ghost but he.\\n\\n“what is it your majesty sees?” asked one of the nobles.\\n\\nthe queen dared not permit an answer to be given to this question. she\\nhurriedly begged her guests to quit a sick man who was likely to grow\\nworse if he was obliged to talk.\\n\\nmacbeth, however, was well enough next day to converse with the witches\\nwhose prophecies had so depraved him.\\n\\nhe found them in a cavern on a thunderous day. they were revolving round\\na cauldron in which were boiling particles of many strange and horrible\\ncreatures, and they knew he was coming before he arrived.\\n\\n“answer me what i ask you,” said the king.\\n\\n“would you rather hear it from us or our masters?” asked the first\\nwitch.\\n\\n“call them,” replied macbeth.\\n\\nthereupon the witches poured blood into the cauldron and grease into the\\nflame that licked it, and a helmeted head appeared with the visor on, so\\nthat macbeth could only see its eyes.\\n\\nhe was speaking to the head, when the first witch said gravely, “he\\nknows thy thought,” and a voice in the head said, “macbeth, beware\\nmacduff, the chieftain of fife.” the head then descended into the\\ncauldron till it disappeared.\\n\\n“one word more,” pleaded macbeth.\\n\\n“he will not be commanded,” said the first witch, and then a crowned\\nchild ascended from the cauldron bearing a tree in his hand the child\\nsaid--\\n\\n    “macbeth shall be unconquerable till\\n     the wood of birnam climbs dunsinane hill.”\\n\\n“that will never be,” said macbeth; and he asked to be told if banquo\\'s\\ndescendants would ever rule scotland.\\n\\nthe cauldron sank into the earth; music was heard, and a procession of\\nphantom kings filed past macbeth; behind them was banquo\\'s ghost. in\\neach king, macbeth saw a likeness to banquo, and he counted eight kings.\\n\\nthen he was suddenly left alone.\\n\\nhis next proceeding was to send murderers to macduff\\'s castle. they\\ndid not find macduff, and asked lady macduff where he was. she gave\\na stinging answer, and her questioner called macduff a traitor. “thou\\nliest!” shouted macduff\\'s little son, who was immediately stabbed, and\\nwith his last breath entreated his mother to fly. the murderers did not\\nleave the castle while one of its inmates remained alive.\\n\\nmacduff was in england listening, with malcolm, to a doctor\\'s tale of\\ncures wrought by edward the confessor when his friend ross came to tell\\nhim that his wife and children were no more. at first ross dared not\\nspeak the truth, and turn macduff\\'s bright sympathy with sufferers\\nrelieved by royal virtue into sorrow and hatred. but when malcolm said\\nthat england was sending an army into scotland against macbeth, ross\\nblurted out his news, and macduff cried, “all dead, did you say? all my\\npretty ones and their mother? did you say all?”\\n\\nhis sorry hope was in revenge, but if he could have looked into\\nmacbeth\\'s castle on dunsinane hill, he would have seen at work a force\\nmore solemn than revenge. retribution was working, for lady macbeth was\\nmad. she walked in her sleep amid ghastly dreams. she was wont to wash\\nher hands for a quarter of an hour at a time; but after all her washing,\\nwould still see a red spot of blood upon her skin. it was pitiful to\\nhear her cry that all the perfumes of arabia could not sweeten her\\nlittle hand.\\n\\n“canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?” inquired macbeth of the\\ndoctor, but the doctor replied that his patient must minister to her own\\nmind. this reply gave macbeth a scorn of medicine. “throw physic to the\\ndogs,” he said; “i\\'ll none of it.”\\n\\none day he heard a sound of women crying. an officer approached him and\\nsaid, “the queen, your majesty, is dead.” “out, brief candle,” muttered\\nmacbeth, meaning that life was like a candle, at the mercy of a puff of\\nair. he did not weep; he was too familiar with death.\\n\\npresently a messenger told him that he saw birnam wood on the march.\\nmacbeth called him a liar and a slave, and threatened to hang him if he\\nhad made a mistake. “if you are right you can hang me,” he said.\\n\\nfrom the turret windows of dunsinane castle, birnam wood did indeed\\nappear to be marching. every soldier of the english army held aloft a\\nbough which he had cut from a tree in that wood, and like human trees\\nthey climbed dunsinane hill.\\n\\nmacbeth had still his courage. he went to battle to conquer or die, and\\nthe first thing he did was to kill the english general\\'s son in single\\ncombat. macbeth then felt that no man could fight him and live, and when\\nmacduff came to him blazing for revenge, macbeth said to him, “go back;\\ni have spilt too much of your blood already.”\\n\\n“my voice is in my sword,” replied macduff, and hacked at him and bade\\nhim yield.\\n\\n“i will not yield!” said macbeth, but his last hour had struck. he fell.\\n\\nmacbeth\\'s men were in retreat when macduff came before malcolm holding a\\nking\\'s head by the hair.\\n\\n“hail, king!” he said; and the new king looked at the old.\\n\\nso malcolm reigned after macbeth; but in years that came afterwards the\\ndescendants of banquo were kings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe comedy of errors\\n\\n\\n\\naegeon was a merchant of syracuse, which is a seaport in sicily. his\\nwife was aemilia, and they were very happy until aegeon\\'s manager died,\\nand he was obliged to go by himself to a place called epidamnum on the\\nadriatic. as soon as she could aemilia followed him, and after they had\\nbeen together some time two baby boys were born to them. the babies were\\nexactly alike; even when they were dressed differently they looked the\\nsame.\\n\\nand now you must believe a very strange thing. at the same inn where\\nthese children were born, and on the same day, two baby boys were born\\nto a much poorer couple than aemilia and aegeon; so poor, indeed, were\\nthe parents of these twins that they sold them to the parents of the\\nother twins.\\n\\naemilia was eager to show her children to her friends in syracuse,\\nand in treacherous weather she and aegeon and the four babies sailed\\nhomewards.\\n\\nthey were still far from syracuse when their ship sprang a leak, and the\\ncrew left it in a body by the only boat, caring little what became of\\ntheir passengers.\\n\\naemilia fastened one of her children to a mast and tied one of the\\nslave-children to him; aegeon followed her example with the remaining\\nchildren. then the parents secured themselves to the same masts, and\\nhoped for safety.\\n\\nthe ship, however, suddenly struck a rock and was split in two, and\\naemilia, and the two children whom she had tied, floated away from\\naegeon and the other children. aemilia and her charges were picked up by\\nsome people of epidamnum, but some fishermen of corinth took the\\nbabies from her by force, and she returned to epidanmum alone, and very\\nmiserable. afterwards she settled in ephesus, a famous town in asia\\nminor.\\n\\naegeon and his charges were also saved; and, more fortunate than\\naemilia, he was able to return to syracuse and keep them till they were\\neighteen. his own child he called antipholus, and the slavechild he\\ncalled dromio; and, strangely enough, these were the names given to the\\nchildren who floated away from him.\\n\\nat the age of eighteen the son who was with aegeon grew restless with a\\ndesire to find his brother. aegeon let him depart with his servant, and\\nthe young men are henceforth known as antipholus of syracuse and dromio\\nof syracuse.\\n\\nlet alone, aegeon found his home too dreary to dwell in, and traveled\\nfor five years. he did not, during his absence, learn all the news of\\nsyracuse, or he would never have gone to ephesus.\\n\\nas it was, his melancholy wandering ceased in that town, where he was\\narrested almost as soon as he arrived. he then found that the duke of\\nsyracuse had been acting in so tyrannical a manner to ephesians unlucky\\nenough to fall into his hands, that the government of ephesus had\\nangrily passed a law which punished by death or a fine of a thousand\\npounds any syracusan who should come to ephesus. aegeon was brought\\nbefore solinus, duke of ephesus, who told him that he must die or pay a\\nthousand pounds before the end of the day.\\n\\nyou will think there was fate in this when i tell you that the children\\nwho were kidnaped by the fishermen of corinth were now citizens of\\nephesus, whither they had been brought by duke menaphon, an uncle of\\nduke solinus. they will henceforth be called antipholus of ephesus and\\ndromio of ephesus.\\n\\nmoreover, on the very day when aegeon was arrested, antipholus of\\nsyracuse landed in ephesus and pretended that he came from epidamnum in\\norder to avoid a penalty. he handed his money to his servant dromio of\\nsyracuse, and bade him take it to the centaur inn and remain there till\\nhe came.\\n\\nin less than ten minutes he was met on the mart by dromio of ephesus,\\nhis brother\\'s slave, and immediately mistook him for his own dromio.\\n“why are you back so soon? where did you leave the money?” asked\\nantipholus of syracuse.\\n\\nthis drornio knew of no money except sixpence, which he had received on\\nthe previous wednesday and given to the saddler; but he did know that\\nhis mistress was annoyed because his master was not in to dinner, and he\\nasked antipholus of syracuse to go to a house called the phoenix without\\ndelay. his speech angered the hearer, who would have beaten him if he\\nhad not fled. antipholus of syracuse them went to the centaur, found\\nthat his gold had been deposited there, and walked out of the inn.\\n\\nhe was wandering about ephesus when two beautiful ladies signaled to him\\nwith their hands. they were sisters, and their names were adriana and\\nluciana. adriana was the wife of his brother antipholus of ephesus, and\\nshe had made up her mind, from the strange account given her by dromio\\nof ephesus, that her husband preferred another woman to his wife. “ay,\\nyou may look as if you did not know me,” she said to the man who was\\nreally her brother-in-law, “but i can remember when no words were sweet\\nunless i said them, no meat flavorsome unless i carved it.”\\n\\n“is it i you address?” said antipholus of syracuse stiffly. “i do not\\nknow you.”\\n\\n“fie, brother,” said luciana. “you know perfectly well that she sent\\ndromio to you to bid you come to dinner;” and adriana said, “come, come;\\ni have been made a fool of long enough. my truant husband shall dine\\nwith me and confess his silly pranks and be forgiven.”\\n\\nthey were determined ladies, and antipholus of syracuse grew weary of\\ndisputing with them, and followed them obediently to the phoenix, where\\na very late “mid-day” dinner awaited them.\\n\\nthey were at dinner when antipholus of ephesus and his slave dromio\\ndemanded admittance. “maud, bridget, marian, cecily, gillian, ginn!”\\n shouted dromio of ephesus, who knew all his fellow-servants\\' names by\\nheart.\\n\\nfrom within came the reply, “fool, dray-horse, coxcomb, idiot!” it was\\ndromio of syracuse unconsciously insulting his brother.\\n\\nmaster and man did their best to get in, short of using a crowbar, and\\nfinally went away; but antipholus of ephesus felt so annoyed with his\\nwife that he decided to give a gold chain which he had promised her, to\\nanother woman.\\n\\ninside the phoenix, luciana, who believed antipholus of syracuse to be\\nher sister\\'s husband, attempted, by a discourse in rhyme, when alone\\nwith him, to make him kinder to adriana. in reply he told her that he\\nwas not married, but that he loved her so much that, if luciana were a\\nmermaid, he would gladly lie on the sea if he might feel beneath him her\\nfloating golden hair.\\n\\nluciana was shocked and left him, and reported his lovemaking to\\nadriana, who said that her husband was old and ugly, and not fit to be\\nseen or heard, though secretly she was very fond of him.\\n\\nantipholus of syracuse soon received a visitor in the shape of angelo\\nthe goldsmith, of whom antipholus of ephesus had ordered the chain which\\nhe had promised his wife and intended to give to another woman.\\n\\nthe goldsmith handed the chain to antipholus of syracuse, and treated\\nhis “i bespoke it not” as mere fun, so that the puzzled merchant took\\nthe chain as good-humoredly as he had partaken of adriana\\'s dinner. he\\noffered payment, but angelo foolishly said he would call again.\\n\\nthe consequence was that angelo was without money when a creditor of the\\nsort that stands no nonsense, threatened him with arrest unless he paid\\nhis debt immediately. this creditor had brought a police officer with\\nhim, and angelo was relieved to see antipholus of ephesus coming out of\\nthe house where he had been dining because he had been locked out of the\\nphoenix. bitter was angelo\\'s dismay when antipholus denied receipt of\\nthe chain. angelo could have sent his mother to prison if she had said\\nthat, and he gave antipholus of ephesus in charge.\\n\\nat this moment up came dromio of syracuse and told the wrong antipholus\\nthat he had shipped his goods, and that a favorable wind was blowing.\\nto the ears of antipholus of ephesus this talk was simple nonsense. he\\nwould gladly have beaten the slave, but contented himself with crossly\\ntelling him to hurry to adriana and bid her send to her arrested husband\\na purse of money which she would find in his desk.\\n\\nthough adriana was furious with her husband because she thought he had\\nbeen making love to her sister, she did not prevent luciana from\\ngetting the purse, and she bade dromio of syracuse bring home his master\\nimmediately.\\n\\nunfortunately, before dromio could reach the police station he met his\\nreal master, who had never been arrested, and did not understand what\\nhe meant by offering him a purse. antipholus of syracuse was further\\nsurprised when a lady whom he did not know asked him for a chain that he\\nhad promised her. she was, of course, the lady with whom antipholus of\\nephesus had dined when his brother was occupying his place at table.\\n“avaunt, thou witch!” was the answer which, to her astonishment, she\\nreceived.\\n\\nmeanwhile antipholus of ephesus waited vainly for the money which was\\nto have released him. never a good-tempered man, he was crazy with anger\\nwhen dromio of ephesus, who, of course, had not been instructed to fetch\\na purse, appeared with nothing more useful than a rope. he beat the\\nslave in the street despite the remonstrance of the police officer;\\nand his temper did not mend when adriana, luciana, and a doctor arrived\\nunder the impression that he was mad and must have his pulse felt. he\\nraged so much that men came forward to bind him. but the kindness of\\nadriana spared him this shame. she promised to pay the sum demanded of\\nhim, and asked the doctor to lead him to the phoenix.\\n\\nangelo\\'s merchant creditor being paid, the two were friendly again,\\nand might soon have been seen chatting before an abbey about the odd\\nbehavior of antipholus of ephesus. “softly,” said the merchant at last,\\n“that\\'s he, i think.”\\n\\nit was not; it was antipholus of syracuse with his servant dromio,\\nand he wore angelo\\'s chain round his neck! the reconciled pair fairly\\npounced upon him to know what he meant by denying the receipt of the\\nchain he had the impudence to wear. antipholus of syracuse lost his\\ntemper, and drew his sword, and at that moment adriana and several\\nothers appeared. “hold!” shouted the careful wife. “hurt him not; he is\\nmad. take his sword away. bind him--and dromio too.”\\n\\ndromio of syracuse did not wish to be bound, and he said to his master,\\n“run, master! into that abbey, quick, or we shall be robbed!”\\n\\nthey accordingly retreated into the abbey.\\n\\nadriana, luciana, and a crowd remained outside, and the abbess came out,\\nand said, “people, why do you gather here?”\\n\\n“to fetch my poor distracted husband,” replied adriana.\\n\\nangelo and the merchant remarked that they had not known that he was\\nmad.\\n\\nadriana then told the abbess rather too much about her wifely worries,\\nfor the abbess received the idea that adriana was a shrew, and that\\nif her husband was distracted he had better not return to her for the\\npresent.\\n\\nadriana determined, therefore, to complain to duke solinus, and, lo and\\nbehold! a minute afterwards the great man appeared with officers and two\\nothers. the others were aegeon and the headsman. the thousand marks had\\nnot been found, and aegeon\\'s fate seemed sealed.\\n\\nere the duke could pass the abbey adriana knelt before him, and told a\\nwoeful tale of a mad husband rushing about stealing jewelry and drawing\\nhis sword, adding that the abbess refused to allow her to lead him home.\\n\\nthe duke bade the abbess be summoned, and no sooner had he given the\\norder than a servant from the phoenix ran to adriana with the tale that\\nhis master had singed off the doctor\\'s beard.\\n\\n“nonsense!” said adriana, “he\\'s in the abbey.”\\n\\n“as sure as i live i speak the truth,” said the servant.\\n\\nantipholus of syracuse had not come out of the abbey, before his\\nbrother of ephesus prostrated himself in front of the duke, exclaiming,\\n“justice, most gracious duke, against that woman.” he pointed to\\nadriana. “she has treated another man like her husband in my own house.”\\n\\neven while he was speaking aegeon said, “unless i am delirious, i see my\\nson antipholus.”\\n\\nno one noticed him, and antipholus of ephesus went on to say how the\\ndoctor, whom he called “a threadbare juggler,” had been one of a gang\\nwho tied him to his slave dromio, and thrust them into a vault whence he\\nhad escaped by gnawing through his bonds.\\n\\nthe duke could not understand how the same man who spoke to him was\\nseen to go into the abbey, and he was still wondering when aegeon asked\\nantipholus of ephesus if he was not his son. he replied, “i never saw\\nmy father in my life;” but so deceived was aegeon by his likeness to\\nthe brother whom he had brought up, that he said, “thou art ashamed to\\nacknowledge me in misery.”\\n\\nsoon, however, the abbess advanced with antipholus of syracuse and\\ndromio of syracuse.\\n\\nthen cried adriana, “i see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me;” and\\nantipholus, espying his father, said, “thou art aegeon or his ghost.”\\n\\nit was a day of surprises, for the abbess said, “i will free that man by\\npaying his fine, and gain my husband whom i lost. speak, aegeon, for i\\nam thy wife aemilia.”\\n\\nthe duke was touched. “he is free without a fine,” he said.\\n\\nso aegeon and aemilia were reunited, and adriana and her husband\\nreconciled; but no one was happier than antipholus of syracuse, who, in\\nthe duke\\'s presence, went to luciana and said, “i told you i loved you.\\nwill you be my wife?”\\n\\nher answer was given by a look, and therefore is not written.\\n\\nthe two dromios were glad to think they would receive no more beatings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe merchant of venice\\n\\n\\n\\nantonio was a rich and prosperous merchant of venice. his ships were\\non nearly every sea, and he traded with portugal, with mexico, with\\nengland, and with india. although proud of his riches, he was very\\ngenerous with them, and delighted to use them in relieving the wants of\\nhis friends, among whom his relation, bassanio, held the first place.\\n\\nnow bassanio, like many another gay and gallant gentleman, was reckless\\nand extravagant, and finding that he had not only come to the end of his\\nfortune, but was also unable to pay his creditors, he went to antonio\\nfor further help.\\n\\n“to you, antonio,” he said, “i owe the most in money and in love: and i\\nhave thought of a plan to pay everything i owe if you will but help me.”\\n\\n“say what i can do, and it shall be done,” answered his friend.\\n\\nthen said bassanio, “in belmont is a lady richly left, and from all\\nquarters of the globe renowned suitors come to woo her, not only because\\nshe is rich, but because she is beautiful and good as well. she looked\\non me with such favor when last we met, that i feel sure that i should\\nwin her away from all rivals for her love had i but the means to go to\\nbelmont, where she lives.”\\n\\n“all my fortunes,” said antonio, “are at sea, and so i have no ready\\nmoney; but luckily my credit is good in venice, and i will borrow for\\nyou what you need.”\\n\\nthere was living in venice at this time a rich money-lender, named\\nshylock. antonio despised and disliked this man very much, and treated\\nhim with the greatest harshness and scorn. he would thrust him, like a\\ncur, over his threshold, and would even spit on him. shylock submitted\\nto all these indignities with a patient shrug; but deep in his heart he\\ncherished a desire for revenge on the rich, smug merchant. for antonio\\nboth hurt his pride and injured his business. “but for him,” thought\\nshylock, “i should be richer by half a million ducats. on the market\\nplace, and wherever he can, he denounces the rate of interest i charge,\\nand--worse than that--he lends out money freely.”\\n\\nso when bassanio came to him to ask for a loan of three thousand ducats\\nto antonio for three months, shylock hid his hatred, and turning to\\nantonio, said--“harshly as you have treated me, i would be friends with\\nyou and have your love. so i will lend you the money and charge you no\\ninterest. but, just for fun, you shall sign a bond in which it shall be\\nagreed that if you do not repay me in three months\\' time, then i shall\\nhave the right to a pound of your flesh, to be cut from what part of\\nyour body i choose.”\\n\\n“no,” cried bassanio to his friend, “you shall run no such risk for me.”\\n\\n“why, fear not,” said antonio, “my ships will be home a month before the\\ntime. i will sign the bond.”\\n\\nthus bassanio was furnished with the means to go to belmont, there to\\nwoo the lovely portia. the very night he started, the money-lender\\'s\\npretty daughter, jessica, ran away from her father\\'s house with her\\nlover, and she took with her from her father\\'s hoards some bags of\\nducats and precious stones. shylock\\'s grief and anger were terrible to\\nsee. his love for her changed to hate. “i would she were dead at my\\nfeet and the jewels in her ear,” he cried. his only comfort now was in\\nhearing of the serious losses which had befallen antonio, some of whose\\nships were wrecked. “let him look to his bond,” said shylock, “let him\\nlook to his bond.”\\n\\nmeanwhile bassanio had reached belmont, and had visited the fair portia.\\nhe found, as he had told antonio, that the rumor of her wealth and\\nbeauty had drawn to her suitors from far and near. but to all of them\\nportia had but one reply. she would only accept that suitor who would\\npledge himself to abide by the terms of her father\\'s will. these were\\nconditions that frightened away many an ardent wooer. for he who would\\nwin portia\\'s heart and hand, had to guess which of three caskets held\\nher portrait. if he guessed aright, then portia would be his bride; if\\nwrong, then he was bound by oath never to reveal which casket he chose,\\nnever to marry, and to go away at once.\\n\\nthe caskets were of gold, silver, and lead. the gold one bore this\\ninscription:--“who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;”\\n the silver one had this:--“who chooseth me shall get as much as he\\ndeserves;” while on the lead one were these words:--“who chooseth me\\nmust give and hazard all he hath.” the prince of morocco, as brave as he\\nwas black, was among the first to submit to this test. he chose the\\ngold casket, for he said neither base lead nor silver could contain her\\npicture. so be chose the gold casket, and found inside the likeness of\\nwhat many men desire--death.\\n\\nafter him came the haughty prince of arragon, and saying, “let me have\\nwhat i deserve--surely i deserve the lady,” he chose the silver one, and\\nfound inside a fool\\'s head. “did i deserve no more than a fool\\'s head?”\\n he cried.\\n\\nthen at last came bassanio, and portia would have delayed him from\\nmaking his choice from very fear of his choosing wrong. for she loved\\nhim dearly, even as he loved her. “but,” said bassanio, “let me choose at\\nonce, for, as i am, i live upon the rack.”\\n\\nthen portia bade her servants to bring music and play while her gallant\\nlover made his choice. and bassanio took the oath and walked up to the\\ncaskets--the musicians playing softly the while. “mere outward show,” he\\nsaid, “is to be despised. the world is still deceived with ornament, and\\nso no gaudy gold or shining silver for me. i choose the lead casket;\\njoy be the consequence!” and opening it, he found fair portia\\'s portrait\\ninside, and he turned to her and asked if it were true that she was his.\\n\\n“yes,” said portia, “i am yours, and this house is yours, and with them\\ni give you this ring, from which you must never part.”\\n\\nand bassanio, saying that he could hardly speak for joy, found words to\\nswear that he would never part with the ring while he lived.\\n\\nthen suddenly all his happiness was dashed with sorrow, for messengers\\ncame from venice to tell him that antonio was ruined, and that shylock\\ndemanded from the duke the fulfilment of the bond, under which he was\\nentitled to a pound of the merchant\\'s flesh. portia was as grieved as\\nbassanio to hear of the danger which threatened his friend.\\n\\n“first,” she said, “take me to church and make me your wife, and then\\ngo to venice at once to help your friend. you shall take with you money\\nenough to pay his debt twenty times over.”\\n\\nbut when her newly-made husband had gone, portia went after him, and\\narrived in venice disguised as a lawyer, and with an introduction from\\na celebrated lawyer bellario, whom the duke of venice had called in\\nto decide the legal questions raised by shylock\\'s claim to a pound of\\nantonio\\'s flesh. when the court met, bassanio offered shylock twice the\\nmoney borrowed, if he would withdraw his claim. but the money-lender\\'s\\nonly answer was--\\n\\n   “if every ducat in six thousand ducats,\\n    were in six parts, and every part a ducat,\\n    i would not draw them,--i would have my bond.”\\n\\nit was then that portia arrived in her disguise, and not even her own\\nhusband knew her. the duke gave her welcome on account of the great\\nbellario\\'s introduction, and left the settlement of the case to her.\\nthen in noble words she bade shylock have mercy. but he was deaf to her\\nentreaties. “i will have the pound of flesh,” was his reply.\\n\\n“what have you to say?” asked portia of the merchant.\\n\\n“but little,” he answered; “i am armed and well prepared.”\\n\\n“the court awards you a pound of antonio\\'s flesh,” said portia to the\\nmoney-lender.\\n\\n“most righteous judge!” cried shylock. “a sentence: come, prepare.”\\n\\n“tarry a little. this bond gives you no right to antonio\\'s blood, only\\nto his flesh. if, then, you spill a drop of his blood, all your property\\nwill be forfeited to the state. such is the law.”\\n\\nand shylock, in his fear, said, “then i will take bassanio\\'s offer.”\\n\\n“no,” said portia sternly, “you shall have nothing but your bond. take\\nyour pound of flesh, but remember, that if you take more or less, even\\nby the weight of a hair, you will lose your property and your life.”\\n\\nshylock now grew very much frightened. “give me my three thousand ducats\\nthat i lent him, and let him go.”\\n\\nbassanio would have paid it to him, but said portia, “no! he shall have\\nnothing but his bond.”\\n\\n“you, a foreigner,” she added, “have sought to take the life of a\\nvenetian citizen, and thus by the venetian law, your life and goods are\\nforfeited. down, therefore, and beg mercy of the duke.”\\n\\nthus were the tables turned, and no mercy would have been shown to\\nshylock had it not been for antonio. as it was, the money-lender\\nforfeited half his fortune to the state, and he had to settle the other\\nhalf on his daughter\\'s husband, and with this he had to be content.\\n\\nbassanio, in his gratitude to the clever lawyer, was induced to part\\nwith the ring his wife had given him, and with which he had promised\\nnever to part, and when on his return to belmont he confessed as much to\\nportia, she seemed very angry, and vowed she would not be friends with\\nhim until she had her ring again. but at last she told him that it was\\nshe who, in the disguise of the lawyer, had saved his friend\\'s life, and\\ngot the ring from him. so bassanio was forgiven, and made happier\\nthan ever, to know how rich a prize he had drawn in the lottery of the\\ncaskets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntimon of athens\\n\\n\\n\\nfour hundred years before the birth of christ, a man lived in athens\\nwhose generosity was not only great, but absurd. he was very rich, but\\nno worldly wealth was enough for a man who spent and gave like timon. if\\nanybody gave timon a horse, he received from timon twenty better horses.\\nif anybody borrowed money of timon and offered to repay it, timon was\\noffended. if a poet had written a poem and timon had time to read it, he\\nwould be sure to buy it; and a painter had only to hold up his canvas in\\nfront of timon to receive double its market price.\\n\\nflavius, his steward, looked with dismay at his reckless mode of life.\\nwhen timon\\'s house was full of noisy lords drinking and spilling costly\\nwine, flavius would sit in a cellar and cry. he would say to himself,\\n“there are ten thousand candles burning in this house, and each of those\\nsingers braying in the concert-room costs a poor man\\'s yearly income a\\nnight;” and he would remember a terrible thing said by apemantus, one of\\nhis master\\'s friends, “o what a number of men eat timon, and timon sees\\nthem not!”\\n\\nof course, timon was much praised.\\n\\na jeweler who sold him a diamond pretended that it was not quite perfect\\ntill timon wore it. “you mend the jewel by wearing it,” he said. timon\\ngave the diamond to a lord called sempronius, and the lord exclaimed,\\n“o, he\\'s the very soul of bounty.” “timon is infinitely dear to me,”\\n said another lord, called lucullus, to whom he gave a beautiful horse;\\nand other athenians paid him compliments as sweet.\\n\\nbut when apemantus had listened to some of them, he said, “i\\'m going to\\nknock out an honest athenian\\'s brains.”\\n\\n“you will die for that,” said timon.\\n\\n“then i shall die for doing nothing,” said apemantus. and now you know\\nwhat a joke was like four hundred years before christ.\\n\\nthis apernantus was a frank despiser of mankind, but a healthy one,\\nbecause he was not unhappy. in this mixed world anyone with a number\\nof acquaintances knows a person who talks bitterly of men, but does not\\nshun them, and boasts that he is never deceived by their fine speeches,\\nand is inwardly cheerful and proud. apemantus was a man like that.\\n\\ntimon, you will be surprised to hear, became much worse than apemantus,\\nafter the dawning of a day which we call quarter day.\\n\\nquarter day is the day when bills pour in. the grocer, the butcher, and\\nthe baker are all thinking of their debtors on that day, and the wise\\nman has saved enough money to be ready for them. but timon had not; and\\nhe did not only owe money for food. he owed it for jewels and horses and\\nfurniture; and, worst of all, he owed it to money-lenders, who expected\\nhim to pay twice as much as he had borrowed.\\n\\nquarter day is a day when promises to pay are scorned, and on that day\\ntimon was asked for a large sum of money. “sell some land,” he said\\nto his steward. “you have no land,” was the reply. “nonsense! i had a\\nhundred, thousand acres,” said timon. “you could have spent the price of\\nthe world if you had possessed it,” said flavius.\\n\\n“borrow some then,” said timon; “try ventidius.” he thought of ventidius\\nbecause he had once got ventidius out of prison by paying a creditor of\\nthis young man. ventidius was now rich. timon trusted in his gratitude.\\nbut not for all; so much did he owe! servants were despatched with\\nrequests for loans of money to several friends:\\n\\none servant (flaminius) went to lucullus. when he was announced lucullus\\nsaid, “a gift, i warrant. i dreamt of a silver jug and basin last\\nnight.” then, changing his tone, “how is that honorable, free-hearted,\\nperfect gentleman, your master, eh?”\\n\\n“well in health, sir,” replied flaminius.\\n\\n“and what have you got there under your cloak?” asked lucullus,\\njovially.\\n\\n“faith, sir, nothing but an empty box, which, on my master\\'s behalf, i\\nbeg you to fill with money, sir.”\\n\\n“la! la! la!” said lucullus, who could not pretend to mean, “ha! ha!\\nha!” “your master\\'s one fault is that he is too fond of giving parties.\\ni\\'ve warned him that it was expensive. now, look here, flaminius, you\\nknow this is no time to lend money without security, so suppose you\\nact like a good boy and tell him that i was not at home. here\\'s three\\nsolidares for yourself.”\\n\\n“back, wretched money,” cried flaminius, “to him who worships you!”\\n\\nothers of timon\\'s friends were tried and found stingy. amongst them was\\nsempronius.\\n\\n“hum,” he said to timon\\'s servant, “has he asked ventidius? ventidius is\\nbeholden to him.”\\n\\n“he refused.”\\n\\n“well, have you asked lucullus?”\\n\\n“he refused.”\\n\\n“a poor compliment to apply to me last of all,” said sempronius, in\\naffected anger. “if he had sent to me at first, i would gladly have lent\\nhim money, but i\\'m not going to be such a fool as to lend him any now.”\\n\\n“your lordship makes a good villain,” said the servant.\\n\\nwhen timon found that his friends were so mean, he took advantage of\\na lull in his storm of creditors to invite ventidius and company to a\\nbanquet. flavius was horrified, but ventidius and company, were not in\\nthe least ashamed, and they assembled accordingly in timon\\'s house, and\\nsaid to one another that their princely host had been jesting with them.\\n\\n“i had to put off an important engagement in order to come here,” said\\nlucullus; “but who could refuse timon?”\\n\\n“it was a real grief to me to be without ready money when he asked for\\nsome,” said sempronius.\\n\\n“the same here,” chimed in a third lord.\\n\\ntimon now appeared, and his guests vied with one another in apologies\\nand compliments. inwardly sneering, timon was gracious to them all.\\n\\nin the banqueting ball was a table resplendent with covered dishes.\\nmouths watered. these summer-friends loved good food.\\n\\n“be seated, worthy friends,” said timon. he then prayed aloud to the\\ngods of greece. “give each man enough,” he said, “for if you, who are\\nour gods, were to borrow of men they would cease to adore you. let men\\nlove the joint more than the host. let every score of guests contain\\ntwenty villains. bless my friends as much as they have blessed me.\\nuncover the dishes, dogs, and lap!”\\n\\nthe hungry lords were too much surprised by this speech to resent it.\\nthey thought timon was unwell, and, although he had called them dogs,\\nthey uncovered the dishes.\\n\\nthere was nothing in them but warm water.\\n\\n“may you never see a better feast,” wished timon “i wash off the\\nflatteries with which you plastered me and sprinkle you with your\\nvillainy.” with these words he threw the water into his guests\\' faces,\\nand then he pelted them with the dishes. having thus ended the banquet,\\nhe went into an outhouse, seized a spade, and quitted athens for ever.\\n\\nhis next dwelling was a cave near the sea.\\n\\nof all his friends, the only one who had not refused him aid was a\\nhandsome soldier named alcibiades, and he had not been asked because,\\nhaving quarreled with the government of athens, he had left that town.\\nthe thought that alcibiades might have proved a true friend did not\\nsoften timon\\'s bitter feeling. he was too weak-minded to discern\\nthe fact that good cannot be far from evil in this mixed world. he\\ndetermined to see nothing better in all mankind than the ingratitude of\\nventidius and the meanness of lucullus.\\n\\nhe became a vegetarian, and talked pages to himself as he dug in the\\nearth for food.\\n\\none day, when he was digging for roots near the shore, his spade struck\\ngold. if he had been a wise man he would have enriched himself quickly,\\nand returned to athens to live in comfort. but the sight of the gold\\nvein gave no joy but only scorn to timon. “this yellow slave,” he said,\\n“will make and break religions. it will make black white and foul fair.\\nit will buy murder and bless the accursed.”\\n\\nhe was still ranting when alcibiades, now an enemy of athens, approached\\nwith his soldiers and two beautiful women who cared for nothing but\\npleasure.\\n\\ntimon was so changed by his bad thoughts and rough life that alcibiades\\ndid not recognize him at first.\\n\\n“who are you?” he asked.\\n\\n“a beast, as you are,” was the reply.\\n\\nalcibiades knew his voice, and offered him help and money. but timon\\nwould none of it, and began to insult the women. they, however, when\\nthey found he had discovered a gold mine, cared not a jot for his\\nopinion of them, but said, “give us some gold, good timon. have you\\nmore?”\\n\\nwith further insults, timon filled their aprons with gold ore.\\n\\n“farewell,” said alcibiades, who deemed that timon\\'s wits were lost; and\\nthen his disciplined soldiers left without profit the mine which could\\nhave paid their wages, and marched towards athens.\\n\\ntimon continued to dig and curse, and affected great delight when he dug\\nup a root and discovered that it was not a grape.\\n\\njust then apemantus appeared. “i am told that you imitate me,” said\\napemantus. “only,” said timon, “because you haven\\'t a dog which i can\\nimitate.”\\n\\n“you are revenging yourself on your friends by punishing yourself,” said\\napemantus. “that is very silly, for they live just as comfortably as\\nthey ever did. i am sorry that a fool should imitate me.”\\n\\n“if i were like you,” said timon, “i should throw myself away.”\\n\\n“you have done so,” sneered apemantus. “will the cold brook make you a\\ngood morning drink, or an east wind warm your clothes as a valet would?”\\n\\n“off with you!” said timon; but apemantus stayed a while longer and told\\nhim he had a passion for extremes, which was true. apemantus even made a\\npun, but there was no good laughter to be got out of timon.\\n\\nfinally, they lost their temper like two schoolboys, and timon said he\\nwas sorry to lose the stone which he flung at apemantus, who left him\\nwith an evil wish.\\n\\nthis was almost an “at home” day for timon, for when apemantus had\\ndeparted, he was visited by some robbers. they wanted gold.\\n\\n“you want too much,” said timon. “here are water, roots and berries.”\\n\\n“we are not birds and pigs,” said a robber.\\n\\n“no, you are cannibals,” said timon. “take the gold, then, and may it\\npoison you! henceforth rob one another.”\\n\\nhe spoke so frightfully to them that, though they went away with full\\npockets, they almost repented of their trade. his last visitor on that\\nday of visits was his good steward flavius. “my dearest master!” cried\\nhe.\\n\\n“away! what are you?” said timon.\\n\\n“have you forgotten me, sir?” asked flavius, mournfully.\\n\\n“i have forgotten all men,” was the reply; “and if you\\'ll allow that you\\nare a man, i have forgotten you.”\\n\\n“i was your honest servant,” said flavius.\\n\\n“nonsense! i never had an honest man about me,” retorted timon.\\n\\nflavius began to cry.\\n\\n“what! shedding tears?” said timon. “come nearer, then. i will love you\\nbecause you are a woman, and unlike men, who only weep when they laugh\\nor beg.”\\n\\nthey talked awhile; then timon said, “yon gold is mine. i will make you\\nrich, flavius, if you promise me to live by yourself and hate mankind.\\ni will make you very rich if you promise me that you will see the flesh\\nslide off the beggar\\'s bones before you feed him, and let the debtor die\\nin jail before you pay his debt.”\\n\\nflavius simply said, “let me stay to comfort you, my master.”\\n\\n“if you dislike cursing, leave me,” replied timon, and he turned his\\nback on flavius, who went sadly back to athens, too much accustomed to\\nobedience to force his services upon his ailing master.\\n\\nthe steward had accepted nothing, but a report got about that a mighty\\nnugget of gold had been given him by his former master, and timon\\ntherefore received more visitors. they were a painter and a poet, whom\\nhe had patronized in his prosperity.\\n\\n“hail, worthy timon!” said the poet. “we heard with astonishment how\\nyour friends deserted you. no whip\\'s large enough for their backs!”\\n\\n“we have come,” put in the painter, “to offer our services.”\\n\\n“you\\'ve heard that i have gold,” said timon.\\n\\n“there was a report,” said the painter, blushing; “but my friend and i\\ndid not come for that.”\\n\\n“good honest men!” jeered timon. “all the same, you shall have plenty of\\ngold if you will rid me of two villains.”\\n\\n“name them,” said his two visitors in one breath. “both of you!”\\n answered timon. giving the painter a whack with a big stick, he said,\\n“put that into your palette and make money out of it.” then he gave a\\nwhack to the poet, and said, “make a poem out of that and get paid for\\nit. there\\'s gold for you.”\\n\\nthey hurriedly withdrew.\\n\\nfinally timon was visited by two senators who, now that athens was\\nthreatened by alcibiades, desired to have on their side this bitter\\nnoble whose gold might help the foe.\\n\\n“forget your injuries,” said the first senator. “athens offers you\\ndignities whereby you may honorably live.”\\n\\n“athens confesses that your merit was overlooked, and wishes to atone,\\nand more than atone, for her forgetfulness,” said the second senator.\\n\\n“worthy senators,” replied timon, in his grim way, “i am almost weeping;\\nyou touch me so! all i need are the eyes of a woman and the heart of a\\nfool.”\\n\\nbut the senators were patriots. they believed that this bitter man could\\nsave athens, and they would not quarrel with him. “be our captain,”\\n they said, “and lead athens against alcibiades, who threatens to destroy\\nher.”\\n\\n“let him destroy the athenians too, for all i care,” said timon; and\\nseeing an evil despair in his face, they left him.\\n\\nthe senators returned to athens, and soon afterwards trumpets were blown\\nbefore its walls. upon the walls they stood and listened to alcibiades,\\nwho told them that wrong-doers should quake in their easy chairs. they\\nlooked at his confident army, and were convinced that athens must yield\\nif he assaulted it, therefore they used the voice that strikes deeper\\nthan arrows.\\n\\n“these walls of ours were built by the hands of men who never wronged\\nyou, alcibiades,” said the first senator.\\n\\n“enter,” said the second senator, “and slay every tenth man, if your\\nrevenge needs human flesh.”\\n\\n“spare the cradle,” said the first senator.\\n\\n“i ask only justice,” said alcibiades. “if you admit my army, i will\\ninflict the penalty of your own laws upon any soldier who breaks them.”\\n\\nat that moment a soldier approached alcibiades, and said, “my noble\\ngeneral, timon is dead.” he handed alcibiades a sheet of wax, saying,\\n“he is buried by the sea, on the beach, and over his grave is a stone\\nwith letters on it which i cannot read, and therefore i have impressed\\nthem on wax.”\\n\\nalcibiades read from the sheet of wax this couplet--\\n\\n   “here lie i, timon, who, alive,\\n        all living men did hate.\\n    pass by and say your worst; but pass,\\n        and stay not here your gait.”\\n\\n“dead, then, is noble timon,” said alcibiades; and be entered athens\\nwith an olive branch instead of a sword.\\n\\nso it was one of timon\\'s friends who was generous in a greater matter\\nthan timon\\'s need; yet are the sorrow and rage of timon remembered as a\\nwarning lest another ingratitude should arise to turn love into hate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nothello\\n\\n\\n\\nfour hundred years ago there lived in venice an ensign named iago, who\\nhated his general, othello, for not making him a lieutenant. instead of\\niago, who was strongly recommended, othello had chosen michael cassio,\\nwhose smooth tongue had helped him to win the heart of desdemona. iago\\nhad a friend called roderigo, who supplied him with money and felt he\\ncould not be happy unless desdemona was his wife.\\n\\nothello was a moor, but of so dark a complexion that his enemies called\\nhim a blackamoor. his life had been hard and exciting. he had been\\nvanquished in battle and sold into slavery; and he had been a great\\ntraveler and seen men whose shoulders were higher than their heads.\\nbrave as a lion, he had one great fault--jealousy. his love was a\\nterrible selfishness. to love a woman meant with him to possess her as\\nabsolutely as he possessed something that did not live and think. the\\nstory of othello is a story of jealousy.\\n\\none night iago told roderigo that othello had carried off desdemona\\nwithout the knowledge of her father, brabantio. he persuaded roderigo\\nto arouse brabantio, and when that senator appeared iago told him\\nof desdemona\\'s elopement in the most unpleasant way. though he was\\nothello\\'s officer, he termed him a thief and a barbary horse.\\n\\nbrabantio accused othello before the duke of venice of using sorcery to\\nfascinate his daughter, but othello said that the only sorcery he used\\nwas his voice, which told desdemona his adventures and hair-breadth\\nescapes. desdemona was led into the council-chamber, and she explained\\nhow she could love othello despite his almost black face by saying, “i\\nsaw othello\\'s visage in his mind.”\\n\\nas othello had married desdemona, and she was glad to be his wife, there\\nwas no more to be said against him, especially as the duke wished him to\\ngo to cyprus to defend it against the turks. othello was quite ready to\\ngo, and desdemona, who pleaded to go with him, was permitted to join him\\nat cyprus.\\n\\nothello\\'s feelings on landing in this island were intensely joyful. “oh,\\nmy sweet,” he said to desdemona, who arrived with iago, his wife, and\\nroderigo before him, “i hardly know what i say to you. i am in love with\\nmy own happiness.”\\n\\nnews coming presently that the turkish fleet was out of action, he\\nproclaimed a festival in cyprus from five to eleven at night.\\n\\ncassio was on duty in the castle where othello ruled cyprus, so iago\\ndecided to make the lieutenant drink too much. he had some difficulty,\\nas cassio knew that wine soon went to his head, but servants brought\\nwine into the room where cassio was, and iago sang a drinking song, and\\nso cassio lifted a glass too often to the health of the general.\\n\\nwhen cassio was inclined to be quarrelsome, iago told roderigo to say\\nsomething unpleasant to him. cassio cudgeled roderigo, who ran into the\\npresence of montano, the ex-governor. montano civilly interceded for\\nroderigo, but received so rude an answer from cassio that he said,\\n“come, come, you\\'re drunk!” cassio then wounded him, and iago sent\\nroderigo out to scare the town with a cry of mutiny.\\n\\nthe uproar aroused othello, who, on learning its cause, said, “cassio, i\\nlove thee, but never more be officer of mine.”\\n\\non cassio and iago being alone together, the disgraced man moaned about\\nhis reputation. iago said reputation and humbug were the same thing.\\n“o god,” exclaimed cassio, without heeding him, “that men should put an\\nenemy in their mouths to steal away their brains!”\\n\\niago advised him to beg desdemona to ask othello to pardon him. cassio\\nwas pleased with the advice, and next morning made his request to\\ndesdemona in the garden of the castle. she was kindness itself, and\\nsaid, “be merry, cassio, for i would rather die than forsake your\\ncause.”\\n\\ncassio at that moment saw othello advancing with iago, and retired\\nhurriedly.\\n\\niago said, “i don\\'t like that.”\\n\\n“what did you say?” asked othello, who felt that he had meant something\\nunpleasant, but iago pretended he had said nothing. “was not that cassio\\nwho went from my wife?” asked othello, and iago, who knew that it was\\ncassio and why it was cassio, said, “i cannot think it was cassio who\\nstole away in that guilty manner.”\\n\\ndesdemona told othello that it was grief and humility which made cassio\\nretreat at his approach. she reminded him how cassio had taken his part\\nwhen she was still heart-free, and found fault with her moorish lover.\\nothello was melted, and said, “i will deny thee nothing,” but desdemona\\ntold him that what she asked was as much for his good as dining.\\n\\ndesdemona left the garden, and iago asked if it was really true that\\ncassio had known desdemona before her marriage.\\n\\n“yes,” said othello.\\n\\n“indeed,” said iago, as though something that had mystified him was now\\nvery clear.\\n\\n“is he not honest?” demanded othello, and iago repeated the adjective\\ninquiringly, as though he were afraid to say “no.”\\n\\n“what do you mean?” insisted othello.\\n\\nto this iago would only say the flat opposite of what he said to cassio.\\nhe had told cassio that reputation was humbug. to othello he said, “who\\nsteals my purse steals trash, but he who filches from me my good name\\nruins me.”\\n\\nat this othello almost leapt into the air, and iago was so confident\\nof his jealousy that he ventured to warn him against it. yes, it was no\\nother than iago who called jealousy “the green-eyed monster which doth\\nmock the meat it feeds on.”\\n\\niago having given jealousy one blow, proceeded to feed it with the\\nremark that desdemona deceived her father when she eloped with othello.\\n“if she deceived him, why not you?” was his meaning.\\n\\npresently desdemona re-entered to tell othello that dinner was ready.\\nshe saw that he was ill at ease. he explained it by a pain in his\\nforehead. desdemona then produced a handkerchief, which othello\\nhad given her. a prophetess, two hundred years old, had made this\\nhandkerchief from the silk of sacred silkworms, dyed it in a\\nliquid prepared from the hearts of maidens, and embroidered it with\\nstrawberries. gentle desdemona thought of it simply as a cool, soft\\nthing for a throbbing brow; she knew of no spell upon it that would work\\ndestruction for her who lost it. “let me tie it round your head,” she\\nsaid to othello; “you will be well in an hour.” but othello pettishly\\nsaid it was too small, and let it fall. desdemona and he then went\\nindoors to dinner, and emilia picked up the handkerchief which iago had\\noften asked her to steal.\\n\\nshe was looking at it when iago came in. after a few words about it he\\nsnatched it from her, and bade her leave him.\\n\\nin the garden he was joined by othello, who seemed hungry for the worst\\nlies he could offer. he therefore told othello that he had seen cassio\\nwipe his mouth with a handkerchief, which, because it was spotted with\\nstrawberries, he guessed to be one that othello had given his wife.\\n\\nthe unhappy moor went mad with fury, and iago bade the heavens witness\\nthat he devoted his hand and heart and brain to othello\\'s service. “i\\naccept your love,” said othello. “within three days let me hear that\\ncassio is dead.”\\n\\niago\\'s next step was to leave desdemona\\'s handkerchief in cassio\\'s room.\\ncassio saw it, and knew it was not his, but he liked the strawberry\\npattern on it, and he gave it to his sweetheart bianca and asked her to\\ncopy it for him.\\n\\niago\\'s next move was to induce othello, who had been bullying desdemona\\nabout the handkerchief, to play the eavesdropper to a conversation\\nbetween cassio and himself. his intention was to talk about cassio\\'s\\nsweetheart, and allow othello to suppose that the lady spoken of was\\ndesdemona.\\n\\n“how are you, lieutenant?” asked iago when cassio appeared.\\n\\n“the worse for being called what i am not,” replied cassio, gloomily.\\n\\n“keep on reminding desdemona, and you\\'ll soon be restored,” said iago,\\nadding, in a tone too low for othello to hear, “if bianca could set the\\nmatter right, how quickly it would mend!”\\n\\n“alas! poor rogue,” said cassio, “i really think she loves me,” and like\\nthe talkative coxcomb he was, cassio was led on to boast of bianca\\'s\\nfondness for him, while othello imagined, with choked rage, that he\\nprattled of desdemona, and thought, “i see your nose, cassio, but not\\nthe dog i shall throw it to.”\\n\\nothello was still spying when bianca entered, boiling over with the idea\\nthat cassio, whom she considered her property, had asked her to copy the\\nembroidery on the handkerchief of a new sweetheart. she tossed him the\\nhandkerchief with scornful words, and cassio departed with her.\\n\\nothello had seen bianca, who was in station lower, in beauty and speech\\ninferior far, to desdemona and he began in spite of himself to praise\\nhis wife to the villain before him. he praised her skill with the\\nneedle, her voice that could “sing the savageness out of a bear,” her\\nwit, her sweetness, the fairness of her skin. every time he praised\\nher iago said something that made him remember his anger and utter it\\nfoully, and yet he must needs praise her, and say, “the pity of it,\\niago! o iago, the pity of it, iago!”\\n\\nthere was never in all iago\\'s villainy one moment of wavering. if there\\nhad been he might have wavered then.\\n\\n“strangle her,” he said; and “good, good!” said his miserable dupe.\\n\\nthe pair were still talking murder when desdemona appeared with a\\nrelative of desdemona\\'s father, called lodovico, who bore a letter\\nfor othello from the duke of venice. the letter recalled othello from\\ncyprus, and gave the governorship to cassio.\\n\\nluckless desdemona seized this unhappy moment to urge once more the suit\\nof cassio.\\n\\n“fire and brimstone!” shouted othello.\\n\\n“it may be the letter agitates him,” explained lodovico to desdemona,\\nand he told her what it contained.\\n\\n“i am glad,” said desdemona. it was the first bitter speech that\\nothello\\'s unkindness had wrung out of her.\\n\\n“i am glad to see you lose your temper,” said othello.\\n\\n“why, sweet othello?” she asked, sarcastically; and othello slapped her\\nface.\\n\\nnow was the time for desdemona to have saved her life by separation, but\\nshe knew not her peril--only that her love was wounded to the core. “i\\nhave not deserved this,” she said, and the tears rolled slowly down her\\nface.\\n\\nlodovico was shocked and disgusted. “my lord,” he said, “this would not\\nbe believed in venice. make her amends;” but, like a madman talking in\\nhis nightmare, othello poured out his foul thought in ugly speech, and\\nroared, “out of my sight!”\\n\\n“i will not stay to offend you,” said his wife, but she lingered even in\\ngoing, and only when he shouted “avaunt!” did she leave her husband and\\nhis guests.\\n\\nothello then invited lodovico to supper, adding, “you are welcome, sir,\\nto cyprus. goats and monkeys!” without waiting for a reply he left the\\ncompany.\\n\\ndistinguished visitors detest being obliged to look on at family\\nquarrels, and dislike being called either goats or monkeys, and lodovico\\nasked iago for an explanation.\\n\\ntrue to himself, iago, in a round-about way, said that othello was worse\\nthan he seemed, and advised them to study his behavior and save him from\\nthe discomfort of answering any more questions.\\n\\nhe proceeded to tell roderigo to murder cassio. roderigo was out of tune\\nwith his friend. he had given iago quantities of jewels for desdemona\\nwithout effect; desdemona had seen none of them, for iago was a thief.\\n\\niago smoothed him with a lie, and when cassio was leaving bianca\\'s\\nhouse, roderigo wounded him, and was wounded in return. cassio shouted,\\nand lodovico and a friend came running up. cassio pointed out roderigo\\nas his assailant, and iago, hoping to rid himself of an inconvenient\\nfriend, called him “villain!” and stabbed him, but not to death.\\n\\nat the castle, desdemona was in a sad mood. she told emilia that she\\nmust leave her; her husband wished it. “dismiss me!” exclaimed emilia.\\n“it was his bidding, said desdemona; we must not displease him now.”\\n\\nshe sang a song which a girl had sung whose lover had been base to\\nher--a song of a maiden crying by that tree whose boughs droop as though\\nit weeps, and she went to bed and slept.\\n\\nshe woke with her husband\\'s wild eyes upon her. “have you prayed\\nto-night?” he asked; and he told this blameless and sweet woman to ask\\ngod\\'s pardon for any sin she might have on her conscience. “i would not\\nkill thy soul,” he said.\\n\\nhe told her that cassio had confessed, but she knew cassio had nought to\\nconfess that concerned her. she said that cassio could not say anything\\nthat would damage her. othello said his mouth was stopped.\\n\\nthen desdemona wept, but with violent words, in spite of all her\\npleading, othello pressed upon her throat and mortally hurt her.\\n\\nthen with boding heart came emilia, and besought entrance at the door,\\nand othello unlocked it, and a voice came from the bed saying, “a\\nguiltless death i die.”\\n\\n“who did it?” cried emilia; and the voice said, “nobody--i myself.\\nfarewell!”\\n\\n“\\'twas i that killed her,” said othello.\\n\\nhe poured out his evidence by that sad bed to the people who came\\nrunning in, iago among them; but when he spoke of the handkerchief,\\nemilia told the truth.\\n\\nand othello knew. “are there no stones in heaven but thunderbolts?” he\\nexclaimed, and ran at iago, who gave emilia her death-blow and fled.\\n\\nbut they brought him back, and the death that came to him later on was a\\nrelief from torture.\\n\\nthey would have taken othello back to venice to try him there, but he\\nescaped them on his sword. “a word or two before you go,” he said to the\\nvenetians in the chamber. “speak of me as i was--no better, no worse.\\nsay i cast away the pearl of pearls, and wept with these hard eyes; and\\nsay that, when in aleppo years ago i saw a turk beating a venetian, i\\ntook him by the throat and smote him thus.”\\n\\nwith his own hand he stabbed himself to the heart; and ere he died his\\nlips touched the face of desdemona with despairing love.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe taming of the shrew\\n\\n\\n\\nthere lived in padua a gentleman named baptista, who had two fair\\ndaughters. the eldest, katharine, was so very cross and ill-tempered,\\nand unmannerly, that no one ever dreamed of marrying her, while her\\nsister, bianca, was so sweet and pretty, and pleasant-spoken, that more\\nthan one suitor asked her father for her hand. but baptista said the\\nelder daughter must marry first.\\n\\nso bianca\\'s suitors decided among themselves to try and get some one to\\nmarry katharine--and then the father could at least be got to listen to\\ntheir suit for bianca.\\n\\na gentleman from verona, named petruchio, was the one they thought\\nof, and, half in jest, they asked him if he would marry katharine, the\\ndisagreeable scold. much to their surprise he said yes, that was just\\nthe sort of wife for him, and if katharine were handsome and rich, he\\nhimself would undertake soon to make her good-tempered.\\n\\npetruchio began by asking baptista\\'s permission to pay court to his\\ngentle daughter katharine--and baptista was obliged to own that she\\nwas anything but gentle. and just then her music master rushed in,\\ncomplaining that the naughty girl had broken her lute over his head,\\nbecause he told her she was not playing correctly.\\n\\n“never mind,” said petruchio, “i love her better than ever, and long to\\nhave some chat with her.”\\n\\nwhen katharine came, he said, “good-morrow, kate--for that, i hear, is\\nyour name.”\\n\\n“you\\'ve only heard half,” said katharine, rudely.\\n\\n“oh, no,” said petruchio, “they call you plain kate, and bonny kate, and\\nsometimes kate the shrew, and so, hearing your mildness praised in every\\ntown, and your beauty too, i ask you for my wife.”\\n\\n“your wife!” cried kate. “never!” she said some extremely disagreeable\\nthings to him, and, i am sorry to say, ended by boxing his ears.\\n\\n“if you do that again, i\\'ll cuff you,” he said quietly; and still\\nprotested, with many compliments, that he would marry none but her.\\n\\nwhen baptista came back, he asked at once--\\n\\n“how speed you with my daughter?”\\n\\n“how should i speed but well,” replied petruchio--“how, but well?”\\n\\n“how now, daughter katharine?” the father went on.\\n\\n“i don\\'t think,” said katharine, angrily, “you are acting a father\\'s\\npart in wishing me to marry this mad-cap ruffian.”\\n\\n“ah!” said petruchio, “you and all the world would talk amiss of her.\\nyou should see how kind she is to me when we are alone. in short, i will\\ngo off to venice to buy fine things for our wedding--for--kiss me, kate!\\nwe will be married on sunday.”\\n\\nwith that, katharine flounced out of the room by one door in a violent\\ntemper, and he, laughing, went out by the other. but whether she fell in\\nlove with petruchio, or whether she was only glad to meet a man who was\\nnot afraid of her, or whether she was flattered that, in spite of her\\nrough words and spiteful usage, he still desired her for his wife--she\\ndid indeed marry him on sunday, as he had sworn she should.\\n\\nto vex and humble katharine\\'s naughty, proud spirit, he was late at the\\nwedding, and when he came, came wearing such shabby clothes that she was\\nashamed to be seen with him. his servant was dressed in the same shabby\\nway, and the horses they rode were the sport of everyone they passed.\\n\\nand, after the marriage, when should have been the wedding breakfast,\\npetruchio carried his wife away, not allowing her to eat or\\ndrink--saying that she was his now, and he could do as he liked with\\nher.\\n\\nand his manner was so violent, and he behaved all through his wedding in\\nso mad and dreadful a manner, that katharine trembled and went with him.\\nhe mounted her on a stumbling, lean, old horse, and they journeyed by\\nrough muddy ways to petruchio\\'s house, he scolding and snarling all the\\nway.\\n\\nshe was terribly tired when she reached her new home, but petruchio was\\ndetermined that she should neither eat nor sleep that night, for he had\\nmade up his mind to teach his bad-tempered wife a lesson she would never\\nforget.\\n\\nso he welcomed her kindly to his house, but when supper was served\\nhe found fault with everything--the meat was burnt, he said, and\\nill-served, and he loved her far too much to let her eat anything but\\nthe best. at last katharine, tired out with her journey, went supperless\\nto bed. then her husband, still telling her how he loved her, and how\\nanxious he was that she should sleep well, pulled her bed to pieces,\\nthrowing the pillows and bedclothes on the floor, so that she could not\\ngo to bed at all, and still kept growling and scolding at the servants\\nso that kate might see how unbeautiful a thing ill-temper was.\\n\\nthe next day, too, katharine\\'s food was all found fault with, and caught\\naway before she could touch a mouthful, and she was sick and giddy for\\nwant of sleep. then she said to one of the servants--\\n\\n“i pray thee go and get me some repast. i care not what.”\\n\\n“what say you to a neat\\'s foot?” said the servant.\\n\\nkatharine said “yes,” eagerly; but the servant, who was in his master\\'s\\nsecret, said he feared it was not good for hasty-tempered people. would\\nshe like tripe?\\n\\n“bring it me,” said katharine.\\n\\n“i don\\'t think that is good for hasty-tempered people,” said the\\nservant. “what do you say to a dish of beef and mustard?”\\n\\n“i love it,” said kate.\\n\\n“but mustard is too hot.”\\n\\n“why, then, the beef, and let the mustard go,” cried katharine, who was\\ngetting hungrier and hungrier.\\n\\n“no,” said the servant, “you must have the mustard, or you get no beef\\nfrom me.”\\n\\n“then,” cried katharine, losing patience, “let it be both, or one, or\\nanything thou wilt.”\\n\\n“why, then,” said the servant, “the mustard without the beef!”\\n\\nthen katharine saw he was making fun of her, and boxed his ears.\\n\\njust then petruchio brought her some food--but she had scarcely begun\\nto satisfy her hunger, before he called for the tailor to bring her new\\nclothes, and the table was cleared, leaving her still hungry. katharine\\nwas pleased with the pretty new dress and cap that the tailor had made\\nfor her, but petruchio found fault with everything, flung the cap and\\ngown on the floor vowing his dear wife should not wear any such foolish\\nthings.\\n\\n“i will have them,” cried katharine. “all gentlewomen wear such caps as\\nthese--”\\n\\n“when you are gentle you shall have one too,” he answered, “and not\\ntill then.” when he had driven away the tailor with angry words--but\\nprivately asking his friend to see him paid--petruchio said--\\n\\n“come, kate, let\\'s go to your father\\'s, shabby as we are, for as the\\nsun breaks through the darkest clouds, so honor peereth in the meanest\\nhabit. it is about seven o\\'clock now. we shall easily get there by\\ndinner-time.”\\n\\n“it\\'s nearly two,” said kate, but civilly enough, for she had grown to\\nsee that she could not bully her husband, as she had done her father and\\nher sister; “it\\'s nearly two, and it will be supper-time before we get\\nthere.”\\n\\n“it shall be seven,” said petruchio, obstinately, “before i start. why,\\nwhatever i say or do, or think, you do nothing but contradict. i won\\'t\\ngo to-day, and before i do go, it shall be what o\\'clock i say it is.”\\n\\nat last they started for her father\\'s house.\\n\\n“look at the moon,” said he.\\n\\n“it\\'s the sun,” said katharine, and indeed it was.\\n\\n“i say it is the moon. contradicting again! it shall be sun or moon, or\\nwhatever i choose, or i won\\'t take you to your father\\'s.”\\n\\nthen katharine gave in, once and for all. “what you will have it named,”\\n she said, “it is, and so it shall be so for katharine.” and so it was,\\nfor from that moment katharine felt that she had met her master, and\\nnever again showed her naughty tempers to him, or anyone else.\\n\\nso they journeyed on to baptista\\'s house, and arriving there, they found\\nall folks keeping bianca\\'s wedding feast, and that of another newly\\nmarried couple, hortensio and his wife. they were made welcome, and sat\\ndown to the feast, and all was merry, save that hortensio\\'s wife, seeing\\nkatharine subdued to her husband, thought she could safely say many\\ndisagreeable things, that in the old days, when katharine was free and\\nfroward, she would not have dared to say. but katharine answered with\\nsuch spirit and such moderation, that she turned the laugh against the\\nnew bride.\\n\\nafter dinner, when the ladies had retired, baptista joined in a laugh\\nagainst petruchio, saying “now in good sadness, son petruchio, i fear\\nyou have got the veriest shrew of all.”\\n\\n“you are wrong,” said petruchio, “let me prove it to you. each of us\\nshall send a message to his wife, desiring her to come to him, and the\\none whose wife comes most readily shall win a wager which we will agree\\non.”\\n\\nthe others said yes readily enough, for each thought his own wife the\\nmost dutiful, and each thought he was quite sure to win the wager.\\n\\nthey proposed a wager of twenty crowns.\\n\\n“twenty crowns,” said petruchio, “i\\'ll venture so much on my hawk or\\nhound, but twenty times as much upon my wife.”\\n\\n“a hundred then,” cried lucentio, bianca\\'s husband.\\n\\n“content,” cried the others.\\n\\nthen lucentio sent a message to the fair bianca bidding her to come to\\nhim. and baptista said he was certain his daughter would come. but the\\nservant coming back, said--\\n\\n“sir, my mistress is busy, and she cannot come.”\\'\\n\\n“there\\'s an answer for you,” said petruchio.\\n\\n“you may think yourself fortunate if your wife does not send you a\\nworse.”\\n\\n“i hope, better,” petruchio answered. then hortensio said--\\n\\n“go and entreat my wife to come to me at once.”\\n\\n“oh--if you entreat her,” said petruchio.\\n\\n“i am afraid,” answered hortensio, sharply, “do what you can, yours will\\nnot be entreated.”\\n\\nbut now the servant came in, and said--\\n\\n“she says you are playing some jest, she will not come.”\\n\\n“better and better,” cried petruchio; “now go to your mistress and say i\\ncommand her to come to me.”\\n\\nthey all began to laugh, saying they knew what her answer would be, and\\nthat she would not come.\\n\\nthen suddenly baptista cried--\\n\\n“here comes katharine!” and sure enough--there she was.\\n\\n“what do you wish, sir?” she asked her husband.\\n\\n“where are your sister and hortensio\\'s wife?”\\n\\n“talking by the parlor fire.”\\n\\n“fetch them here.”\\n\\nwhen she was gone to fetch them, lucentio said--\\n\\n“here is a wonder!”\\n\\n“i wonder what it means,” said hortensio.\\n\\n“it means peace,” said petruchio, “and love, and quiet life.”\\n\\n“well,” said baptista, “you have won the wager, and i will add\\nanother twenty thousand crowns to her dowry--another dowry for another\\ndaughter--for she is as changed as if she were someone else.”\\n\\nso petruchio won his wager, and had in katharine always a loving wife\\nand true, and now he had broken her proud and angry spirit he loved her\\nwell, and there was nothing ever but love between those two. and so they\\nlived happy ever afterwards.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmeasure for measure\\n\\n\\n\\nmore centuries ago than i care to say, the people of vienna were\\ngoverned too mildly. the reason was that the reigning duke vicentio was\\nexcessively good-natured, and disliked to see offenders made unhappy.\\n\\nthe consequence was that the number of ill-behaved persons in vienna\\nwas enough to make the duke shake his head in sorrow when his chief\\nsecretary showed him it at the end of a list. he decided, therefore,\\nthat wrongdoers must be punished. but popularity was dear to him. he\\nknew that, if he were suddenly strict after being lax, he would cause\\npeople to call him a tyrant. for this reason he told his privy council\\nthat he must go to poland on important business of state. “i have chosen\\nangelo to rule in my absence,” said he.\\n\\nnow this angelo, although he appeared to be noble, was really a mean\\nman. he had promised to marry a girl called mariana, and now would have\\nnothing to say to her, because her dowry had been lost. so poor mariana\\nlived forlornly, waiting every day for the footstep of her stingy lover,\\nand loving him still.\\n\\nhaving appointed angelo his deputy, the duke went to a friar called\\nthomas and asked him for a friar\\'s dress and instruction in the art of\\ngiving religious counsel, for he did not intend to go to poland, but to\\nstay at home and see how angelo governed.\\n\\nangelo had not been a day in office when he condemned to death a young\\nman named claudio for an act of rash selfishness which nowadays would\\nonly be punished by severe reproof.\\n\\nclaudio had a queer friend called lucio, and lucio saw a chance of\\nfreedom for claudio if claudio\\'s beautiful sister isabella would plead\\nwith angelo.\\n\\nisabella was at that time living in a nunnery. nobody had won her heart,\\nand she thought she would like to become a sister, or nun.\\n\\nmeanwhile claudio did not lack an advocate.\\n\\nan ancient lord, escalus, was for leniency. “let us cut a little, but\\nnot kill,” he said. “this gentleman had a most noble father.”\\n\\nangelo was unmoved. “if twelve men find me guilty, i ask no more mercy\\nthan is in the law.”\\n\\nangelo then ordered the provost to see that claudio was executed at nine\\nthe next morning.\\n\\nafter the issue of this order angelo was told that the sister of the\\ncondemned man desired to see him.\\n\\n“admit her,” said angelo.\\n\\non entering with lucio, the beautiful girl said, “i am a woeful suitor\\nto your honor.”\\n\\n“well?” said angelo.\\n\\nshe colored at his chill monosyllable and the ascending red increased\\nthe beauty of her face. “i have a brother who is condemned to die,” she\\ncontinued. “condemn the fault, i pray you, and spare my brother.”\\n\\n“every fault,” said angelo, “is condemned before it is committed. a\\nfault cannot suffer. justice would be void if the committer of a fault\\nwent free.”\\n\\nshe would have left the court if lucio had not whispered to her, “you\\nare too cold; you could not speak more tamely if you wanted a pin.”\\n\\nso isabella attacked angelo again, and when he said, “i will not pardon\\nhim,” she was not discouraged, and when he said, “he\\'s sentenced; \\'tis\\ntoo late,” she returned to the assault. but all her fighting was with\\nreasons, and with reasons she could not prevail over the deputy.\\n\\nshe told him that nothing becomes power like mercy. she told him that\\nhumanity receives and requires mercy from heaven, that it was good to\\nhave gigantic strength, and had to use it like a giant. she told him\\nthat lightning rives the oak and spares the myrtle. she bade him look\\nfor fault in his own breast, and if he found one, to refrain from making\\nit an argument against her brother\\'s life.\\n\\nangelo found a fault in his breast at that moment. he loved isabella\\'s\\nbeauty, and was tempted to do for her beauty what he would not do for\\nthe love of man.\\n\\nhe appeared to relent, for he said, “come to me to-morrow before noon.”\\n\\nshe had, at any rate, succeeded in prolonging her brother\\'s life for a\\nfew hours.\\'\\n\\nin her absence angelo\\'s conscience rebuked him for trifling with his\\njudicial duty.\\n\\nwhen isabella called on him the second time, he said, “your brother\\ncannot live.”\\n\\nisabella was painfully astonished, but all she said was, “even so.\\nheaven keep your honor.”\\n\\nbut as she turned to go, angelo felt that his duty and honor were slight\\nin comparison with the loss of her.\\n\\n“give me your love,” he said, “and claudio shall be freed.”\\n\\n“before i would marry you, he should die if he had twenty heads to lay\\nupon the block,” said isabella, for she saw then that he was not the\\njust man he pretended to be.\\n\\nso she went to her brother in prison, to inform him that he must die.\\nat first he was boastful, and promised to hug the darkness of death.\\nbut when he clearly understood that his sister could buy his life by\\nmarrying angelo, he felt his life more valuable than her happiness, and\\nhe exclaimed, “sweet sister, let me live.”\\n\\n“o faithless coward! o dishonest wretch!” she cried.\\n\\nat this moment the duke came forward, in the habit of a friar, to\\nrequest some speech with isabella. he called himself friar lodowick.\\n\\nthe duke then told her that angelo was affianced to mariana, whose\\nlove-story he related. he then asked her to consider this plan. let\\nmariana, in the dress of isabella, go closely veiled to angelo, and say,\\nin a voice resembling isabella\\'s, that if claudio were spared she would\\nmarry him. let her take the ring from angelo\\'s little finger, that it\\nmight be afterwards proved that his visitor was mariana.\\n\\nisabella had, of course, a great respect for friars, who are as nearly\\nlike nuns as men can be. she agreed, therefore, to the duke\\'s plan. they\\nwere to meet again at the moated grange, mariana\\'s house.\\n\\nin the street the duke saw lucio, who, seeing a man dressed like a\\nfriar, called out, “what news of the duke, friar?” “i have none,” said\\nthe duke.\\n\\nlucio then told the duke some stories about angelo. then he told one\\nabout the duke. the duke contradicted him. lucio was provoked, and\\ncalled the duke “a shallow, ignorant fool,” though he pretended to love\\nhim. “the duke shall know you better if i live to report you,” said the\\nduke, grimly. then he asked escalus, whom he saw in the street, what he\\nthought of his ducal master. escalus, who imagined he was speaking to a\\nfriar, replied, “the duke is a very temperate gentleman, who prefers to\\nsee another merry to being merry himself.”\\n\\nthe duke then proceeded to call on mariana.\\n\\nisabella arrived immediately afterwards, and the duke introduced the\\ntwo girls to one another, both of whom thought he was a friar. they\\nwent into a chamber apart from him to discuss the saving of claudio, and\\nwhile they talked in low and earnest tones, the duke looked out of the\\nwindow and saw the broken sheds and flower-beds black with moss, which\\nbetrayed mariana\\'s indifference to her country dwelling. some women\\nwould have beautified their garden: not she. she was for the town; she\\nneglected the joys of the country. he was sure that angelo would not\\nmake her unhappier.\\n\\n“we are agreed, father,” said isabella, as she returned with mariana.\\n\\nso angelo was deceived by the girl whom he had dismissed from his love,\\nand put on her finger a ring he wore, in which was set a milky stone\\nwhich flashed in the light with secret colors.\\n\\nhearing of her success, the duke went next day to the prison prepared\\nto learn that an order had arrived for claudio\\'s release. it had not,\\nhowever, but a letter was banded to the provost while he waited. his\\namazement was great when the provost read aloud these words, “whatsoever\\nyou may hear to the contrary, let claudio be executed by four of the\\nclock. let me have his head sent me by five.”\\n\\nbut the duke said to the provost, “you must show the deputy another\\nhead,” and he held out a letter and a signet. “here,” he said, “are the\\nhand and seal of the duke. he is to return, i tell you, and angelo knows\\nit not. give angelo another head.”\\n\\nthe provost thought, “this friar speaks with power. i know the duke\\'s\\nsignet and i know his hand.”\\n\\nhe said at length, “a man died in prison this morning, a pirate of the\\nage of claudio, with a beard of his color. i will show his head.”\\n\\nthe pirate\\'s head was duly shown to angelo, who was deceived by its\\nresemblance to claudio\\'s.\\n\\nthe duke\\'s return was so popular that the citizens removed the city\\ngates from their hinges to assist his entry into vienna. angelo and\\nescalus duly presented themselves, and were profusely praised for their\\nconduct of affairs in the duke\\'s absence.\\n\\nit was, therefore, the more unpleasant for angelo when isabella,\\npassionately angered by his treachery, knelt before the duke, and cried\\nfor justice.\\n\\nwhen her story was told, the duke cried, “to prison with her for a\\nslanderer of our right hand! but stay, who persuaded you to come here?”\\n\\n“friar lodowick,” said she.\\n\\n“who knows him?” inquired the duke.\\n\\n“i do, my lord,” replied lucio. “i beat him because he spake against\\nyour grace.”\\n\\na friar called peter here said, “friar lodowick is a holy man.”\\n\\nisabella was removed by an officer, and mariana came forward. she took\\noff her veil, and said to angelo, “this is the face you once swore was\\nworth looking on.”\\n\\nbravely he faced her as she put out her hand and said, “this is the hand\\nwhich wears the ring you thought to give another.”\\n\\n“i know the woman,” said angelo. “once there was talk of marriage\\nbetween us, but i found her frivolous.”\\n\\nmariana here burst out that they were affianced by the strongest vows.\\nangelo replied by asking the duke to insist on the production of friar\\nlodowick.\\n\\n“he shall appear,” promised the duke, and bade escalus examine the\\nmissing witness thoroughly while he was elsewhere.\\n\\npresently the duke re-appeared in the character of friar lodowick, and\\naccompanied by isabella and the provost. he was not so much examined as\\nabused and threatened by escalus. lucio asked him to deny, if he dared,\\nthat he called the duke a fool and a coward, and had had his nose pulled\\nfor his impudence.\\n\\n“to prison with him!” shouted escalus, but as hands were laid upon him,\\nthe duke pulled off his friar\\'s hood, and was a duke before them all.\\n\\n“now,” he said to angelo, “if you have any impudence that can yet serve\\nyou, work it for all it\\'s worth.”\\n\\n“immediate sentence and death is all i beg,” was the reply.\\n\\n“were you affianced to mariana?” asked the duke.\\n\\n“i was,” said angelo.\\n\\n“then marry her instantly,” said his master. “marry them,” he said to\\nfriar peter, “and return with them here.”\\n\\n“come hither, isabel,” said the duke, in tender tones. “your friar is\\nnow your prince, and grieves he was too late to save your brother;” but\\nwell the roguish duke knew he had saved him.\\n\\n“o pardon me,” she cried, “that i employed my sovereign in my trouble.”\\n\\n“you are pardoned,” he said, gaily.\\n\\nat that moment angelo and his wife re-entered. “and now, angelo,” said\\nthe duke, gravely, “we condemn thee to the block on which claudio laid\\nhis head!”\\n\\n“o my most gracious lord,” cried mariana, “mock me not!”\\n\\n“you shall buy a better husband,” said the duke.\\n\\n“o my dear lord,” said she, “i crave no better man.”\\n\\nisabella nobly added her prayer to mariana\\'s, but the duke feigned\\ninflexibility.\\n\\n“provost,” he said, “how came it that claudio as executed at an unusual\\nhour?”\\n\\nafraid to confess the lie he had imposed upon angelo, the provost said,\\n“i had a private message.”\\n\\n“you are discharged from your office,” said the duke. the provost then\\ndeparted. angelo said, “i am sorry to have caused such sorrow. i prefer\\ndeath to mercy.” soon there was a motion in the crowd. the provost\\nre-appeared with claudio. like a big child the provost said, “i\\nsaved this man; he is like claudio.” the duke was amused, and said to\\nisabella, “i pardon him because he is like your brother. he is like my\\nbrother, too, if you, dear isabel, will be mine.”\\n\\nshe was his with a smile, and the duke forgave angelo, and promoted the\\nprovost.\\n\\nlucio he condemned to marry a stout woman with a bitter tongue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwo gentlemen of verona\\n\\n\\n\\nonly one of them was really a gentleman, as you will discover later.\\ntheir names were valentine and proteus. they were friends, and lived\\nat verona, a town in northern italy. valentine was happy in his name\\nbecause it was that of the patron saint of lovers; it is hard for a\\nvalentine to be fickle or mean. proteus was unhappy in his name, because\\nit was that of a famous shape-changer, and therefore it encouraged him\\nto be a lover at one time and a traitor at another.\\n\\none day, valentine told his friend that he was going to milan. “i\\'m\\nnot in love like you,” said he, “and therefore i don\\'t want to stay at\\nhome.”\\n\\nproteus was in love with a beautiful yellow-haired girl called julia,\\nwho was rich, and had no one to order her about. he was, however, sorry\\nto part from valentine, and he said, “if ever you are in danger tell me,\\nand i will pray for you.” valentine then went to milan with a servant\\ncalled speed, and at milan he fell in love with the duke of milan\\'s\\ndaughter, silvia.\\n\\nwhen proteus and valentine parted julia had not acknowledged that she\\nloved proteus. indeed, she had actually torn up one of his letters in\\nthe presence of her maid, lucetta. lucetta, however, was no simpleton,\\nfor when she saw the pieces she said to herself, “all she wants is to be\\nannoyed by another letter.” indeed, no sooner had lucetta left her alone\\nthan julia repented of her tearing, and placed between her dress and her\\nheart the torn piece of paper on which proteus had signed his name. so\\nby tearing a letter written by proteus she discovered that she loved\\nhim. then, like a brave, sweet girl, she wrote to proteus, “be patient,\\nand you shall marry me.”\\n\\ndelighted with these words proteus walked about, flourishing julia\\'s\\nletter and talking to himself.\\n\\n“what have you got there?” asked his father, antonio.\\n\\n“a letter from valentine,” fibbed proteus.\\n\\n“let me read it,” said antonio.\\n\\n“there is no news,” said deceitful proteus; “he only says that he is\\nvery happy, and the duke of milan is kind to him, and that he wishes i\\nwere with him.”\\n\\nthis fib had the effect of making antonio think that his son should go\\nto milan and enjoy the favors in which valentine basked. “you must go\\nto-morrow,” he decreed. proteus was dismayed. “give me time to get my\\noutfit ready.” he was met with the promise, “what you need shall be sent\\nafter you.”\\n\\nit grieved julia to part from her lover before their engagement was two\\ndays\\' old. she gave him a ring, and said, “keep this for my sake,” and\\nhe gave her a ring, and they kissed like two who intend to be true till\\ndeath. then proteus departed for milan.\\n\\nmeanwhile valentine was amusing silvia, whose grey eyes, laughing at him\\nunder auburn hair, had drowned him in love. one day she told him that\\nshe wanted to write a pretty letter to a gentleman whom she thought well\\nof, but had no time: would he write it? very much did valentine dislike\\nwriting that letter, but he did write it, and gave it to her coldly.\\n“take it back,” she said; “you did it unwillingly.”\\n\\n“madam,” he said, “it was difficult to write such a letter for you.”\\n\\n“take it back,” she commanded; “you did not write tenderly enough.”\\n\\nvalentine was left with the letter, and condemned to write another;\\nbut his servant speed saw that, in effect, the lady silvia had allowed\\nvalentine to write for her a love-letter to valentine\\'s own self. “the\\njoke,” he said, “is as invisible as a weather-cock on a steeple.” he\\nmeant that it was very plain; and he went on to say exactly what it was:\\n“if master will write her love-letters, he must answer them.”\\n\\non the arrival of proteus, he was introduced by valentine to silvia and\\nafterwards, when they were alone, valentine asked proteus how his love\\nfor julia was prospering.\\n\\n“why,” said proteus, “you used to get wearied when i spoke of her.”\\n\\n“aye,” confessed valentine, “but it\\'s different now. i can eat and drink\\nall day with nothing but love on my plate and love in my cup.”\\n\\n“you idolize silvia,” said proteus.\\n\\n“she is divine,” said valentine.\\n\\n“come, come!” remonstrated proteus.\\n\\n“well, if she\\'s not divine,” said valentine, “she is the queen of all\\nwomen on earth.”\\n\\n“except julia,” said proteus.\\n\\n“dear boy,” said valentine, “julia is not excepted; but i will grant\\nthat she alone is worthy to bear my lady\\'s train.”\\n\\n“your bragging astounds me,” said proteus.\\n\\nbut he had seen silvia, and he felt suddenly that the yellow-haired\\njulia was black in comparison. he became in thought a villain without\\ndelay, and said to himself what he had never said before--“i to myself\\nam dearer than my friend.”\\n\\nit would have been convenient for valentine if proteus had changed, by\\nthe power of the god whose name he bore, the shape of his body at the\\nevil moment when he despised julia in admiring silvia. but his body did\\nnot change; his smile was still affectionate, and valentine confided to\\nhim the great secret that silvia had now promised to run away with him.\\n“in the pocket of this cloak,” said valentine, “i have a silken rope\\nladder, with hooks which will clasp the window-bar of her room.”\\n\\nproteus knew the reason why silvia and her lover were bent on flight.\\nthe duke intended her to wed sir thurio, a gentlemanly noodle for whom\\nshe did not care a straw.\\n\\nproteus thought that if he could get rid of valentine he might make\\nsilvia fond of him, especially if the duke insisted on her enduring\\nsir thurio\\'s tiresome chatter. he therefore went to the duke, and said,\\n“duty before friendship! it grieves me to thwart my friend valentine,\\nbut your grace should know that he intends to-night to elope with your\\ngrace\\'s daughter.” he begged the duke not to tell valentine the giver\\nof this information, and the duke assured him that his name would not be\\ndivulged.\\n\\nearly that evening the duke summoned valentine, who came to him wearing\\na large cloak with a bulging pocket.\\n\\n“you know,” said the duke, “my desire to marry my daughter to sir\\nthurio?”\\n\\n“i do,” replied valentine. “he is virtuous and generous, as befits a man\\nso honored in your grace\\'s thoughts.”\\n\\n“nevertheless she dislikes him,” said the duke. “she is a peevish,\\nproud, disobedient girl, and i should be sorry to leave her a penny. i\\nintend, therefore, to marry again.”\\n\\nvalentine bowed.\\n\\n“i hardly know how the young people of to-day make love,” continued the\\nduke, “and i thought that you would be just the man to teach me how to\\nwin the lady of my choice.”\\n\\n“jewels have been known to plead rather well,” said valentine.\\n\\n“i have tried them,” said the duke.\\n\\n“the habit of liking the giver may grow if your grace gives her some\\nmore.”\\n\\n“the chief difficulty,” pursued the duke, “is this. the lady is promised\\nto a young gentleman, and it is hard to have a word with her. she is, in\\nfact, locked up.”\\n\\n“then your grace should propose an elopement,” said valentine. “try a\\nrope ladder.”\\n\\n“but how should i carry it?” asked the duke.\\n\\n“a rope ladder is light,” said valentine; “you can carry it in a cloak.”\\n\\n“like yours?”\\n\\n“yes, your grace.”\\n\\n“then yours will do. kindly lend it to me.”\\n\\nvalentine had talked himself into a trap. he could not refuse to lend\\nhis cloak, and when the duke had donned it, his grace drew from the\\npocket a sealed missive addressed to silvia. he coolly opened it, and\\nread these words: “silvia, you shall be free to-night.”\\n\\n“indeed,” he said, “and here\\'s the rope ladder. prettily contrived, but\\nnot perfectly. i give you, sir, a day to leave my dominions. if you are\\nin milan by this time to-morrow, you die.”\\n\\npoor valentine was saddened to the core. “unless i look on silvia in the\\nday,” he said, “there is no day for me to look upon.”\\n\\nbefore he went he took farewell of proteus, who proved a hypocrite of\\nthe first order. “hope is a lover\\'s staff,” said valentine\\'s betrayer;\\n“walk hence with that.”\\n\\nafter leaving milan, valentine and his servant wandered into a forest\\nnear mantua where the great poet virgil lived. in the forest, however,\\nthe poets (if any) were brigands, who bade the travelers stand. they\\nobeyed, and valentine made so good an impression upon his captors that\\nthey offered him his life on condition that he became their captain.\\n\\n“i accept,” said valentine, “provided you release my servant, and are\\nnot violent to women or the poor.”\\n\\nthe reply was worthy of virgil, and valentine became a brigand chief.\\n\\nwe return now to julia, who found verona too dull to live in since\\nproteus had gone. she begged her maid lucetta to devise a way by which\\nshe could see him. “better wait for him to return,” said lucetta, and\\nshe talked so sensibly that julia saw it was idle to hope that lucetta\\nwould bear the blame of any rash and interesting adventure. julia\\ntherefore said that she intended to go to milan and dressed like a page.\\n\\n“you must cut off your hair then,” said lucetta, who thought that at\\nthis announcement julia would immediately abandon her scheme.\\n\\n“i shall knot it up,” was the disappointing rejoinder.\\n\\nlucetta then tried to make the scheme seem foolish to julia, but julia\\nhad made up her mind and was not to be put off by ridicule; and when her\\ntoilet was completed, she looked as comely a page as one could wish to\\nsee.\\n\\njulia assumed the male name sebastian, and arrived in milan in time to\\nhear music being performed outside the duke\\'s palace.\\n\\n“they are serenading the lady silvia,” said a man to her.\\n\\nsuddenly she heard a voice lifted in song, and she knew that voice. it\\nwas the voice of proteus. but what was he singing?\\n\\n   “who is silvia? what is she,\\n      that all our swains commend her?\\n    holy, fair, and wise is she;\\n      the heaven such grace did lend her\\n    that she might admired be.”\\n\\njulia tried not to hear the rest, but these two lines somehow thundered\\ninto her mind--\\n\\n   “then to silvia let us sing;\\n    she excels each mortal thing.”\\n\\nthen proteus thought silvia excelled julia; and, since he sang so\\nbeautifully for all the world to hear, it seemed that he was not only\\nfalse to julia, but had forgotten her. yet julia still loved him. she\\neven went to him, and asked to be his page, and proteus engaged her.\\n\\none day, he handed to her the ring which she had given him, and said,\\n“sebastian, take that to the lady silvia, and say that i should like the\\npicture of her she promised me.”\\n\\nsilvia had promised the picture, but she disliked proteus. she was\\nobliged to talk to him because he was high in the favor of her father,\\nwho thought he pleaded with her on behalf of sir thurio. silvia had\\nlearned from valentine that proteus was pledged to a sweetheart in\\nverona; and when he said tender things to her, she felt that he was\\ndisloyal in friendship as well as love.\\n\\njulia bore the ring to silvia, but silvia said, “i will not wrong the\\nwoman who gave it him by wearing it.”\\n\\n“she thanks you,” said julia.\\n\\n“you know her, then?” said silvia, and julia spoke so tenderly of\\nherself that silvia wished that sebastian would marry julia.\\n\\nsilvia gave julia her portrait for proteus, who would have received it\\nthe worse for extra touches on the nose and eyes if julia had not made\\nup her mind that she was as pretty as silvia.\\n\\nsoon there was an uproar in the palace. silvia had fled.\\n\\nthe duke was certain that her intention was to join the exiled\\nvalentine, and he was not wrong.\\n\\nwithout delay he started in pursuit, with sir thurio, proteus, and some\\nservants.\\n\\nthe members of the pursuing party got separated, and proteus and julia\\n(in her page\\'s dress) were by themselves when they saw silvia, who had\\nbeen taken prisoner by outlaws and was now being led to their captain.\\nproteus rescued her, and then said, “i have saved you from death; give\\nme one kind look.”\\n\\n“o misery, to be helped by you!” cried silvia. “i would rather be a\\nlion\\'s breakfast.”\\n\\njulia was silent, but cheerful. proteus was so much annoyed with silvia\\nthat he threatened her, and seized her by the waist.\\n\\n“o heaven!” cried silvia.\\n\\nat that instant there was a noise of crackling branches. valentine came\\ncrashing through the mantuan forest to the rescue of his beloved. julia\\nfeared he would slay proteus, and hurried to help her false lover. but\\nhe struck no blow, he only said, “proteus, i am sorry i must never trust\\nyou more.”\\n\\nthereat proteus felt his guilt, and fell on his knees, saying, “forgive\\nme! i grieve! i suffer!”\\n\\n“then you are my friend once more,” said the generous valentine. “if\\nsilvia, that is lost to me, will look on you with favor, i promise that\\ni will stand aside and bless you both.”\\n\\nthese words were terrible to julia, and she swooned. valentine revived\\nher, and said, “what was the matter, boy?”\\n\\n“i remembered,” fibbed julia, “that i was charged to give a ring to the\\nlady silvia, and that i did not.”\\n\\n“well, give it to me,” said proteus.\\n\\nshe handed him a ring, but it was the ring that proteus gave to julia\\nbefore he left verona.\\n\\nproteus looked at her hand, and crimsoned to the roots of his hair.\\n\\n“i changed my shape when you changed your mind,” said she.\\n\\n“but i love you again,” said he.\\n\\njust then outlaws entered, bringing two prizes--the duke and sir thurio.\\n\\n“forbear!” cried valentine, sternly. “the duke is sacred.”\\n\\nsir thurio exclaimed, “there\\'s silvia; she\\'s mine!”\\n\\n“touch her, and you die!” said valentine.\\n\\n“i should be a fool to risk anything for her,” said sir thurio.\\n\\n“then you are base,” said the duke. “valentine, you are a brave man.\\nyour banishment is over. i recall you. you may marry silvia. you deserve\\nher.”\\n\\n“i thank your grace,” said valentine, deeply moved, “and yet must ask\\nyou one more boon.”\\n\\n“i grant it,” said the duke.\\n\\n“pardon these men, your grace, and give them employment. they are better\\nthan their calling.”\\n\\n“i pardon them and you,” said the duke. “their work henceforth shall be\\nfor wages.”\\n\\n“what think you of this page, your grace?” asked valentine, indicating\\njulia.\\n\\nthe duke glanced at her, and said, “i think the boy has grace in him.”\\n\\n“more grace than boy, say i,” laughed valentine, and the only punishment\\nwhich proteus had to bear for his treacheries against love and\\nfriendship was the recital in his presence of the adventures of\\njulia-sebastian of verona.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nall\\'s well that ends well\\n\\n\\n\\nin the year thirteen hundred and something, the countess of rousillon\\nwas unhappy in her palace near the pyrenees. she had lost her husband,\\nand the king of france had summoned her son bertram to paris, hundreds\\nof miles away.\\n\\nbertram was a pretty youth with curling hair, finely arched eyebrows,\\nand eyes as keen as a hawk\\'s. he was as proud as ignorance could make\\nhim, and would lie with a face like truth itself to gain a selfish end.\\nbut a pretty youth is a pretty youth, and helena was in love with him.\\n\\nhelena was the daughter of a great doctor who had died in the service\\nof the count of rousillon. her sole fortune consisted in a few of her\\nfather\\'s prescriptions.\\n\\nwhen bertram had gone, helena\\'s forlorn look was noticed by the\\ncountess, who told her that she was exactly the same to her as her\\nown child. tears then gathered in helena\\'s eyes, for she felt that the\\ncountess made bertram seem like a brother whom she could never marry.\\nthe countess guessed her secret forthwith, and helena confessed that\\nbertram was to her as the sun is to the day.\\n\\nshe hoped, however, to win this sun by earning the gratitude of the king\\nof france, who suffered from a lingering illness, which made him lame.\\nthe great doctors attached to the court despaired of curing him, but\\nhelena had confidence in a prescription which her father had used with\\nsuccess.\\n\\ntaking an affectionate leave of the countess, she went to paris, and was\\nallowed to see the king.\\n\\nhe was very polite, but it was plain he thought her a quack. “it would\\nnot become me,” he said, “to apply to a simple maiden for the relief\\nwhich all the learned doctors cannot give me.”\\n\\n“heaven uses weak instruments sometimes,” said helena, and she declared\\nthat she would forfeit her life if she failed to make him well.\\n\\n“and if you succeed?” questioned the king.\\n\\n“then i will ask your majesty to give me for a husband the man whom i\\nchoose!”\\n\\nso earnest a young lady could not be resisted forever by a suffering\\nking. helena, therefore, became the king\\'s doctor, and in two days the\\nroyal cripple could skip.\\n\\nhe summoned his courtiers, and they made a glittering throng in the\\nthrone room of his palace. well might the country girl have been\\ndazzled, and seen a dozen husbands worth dreaming of among the handsome\\nyoung noblemen before her. but her eyes only wandered till they found\\nbertram. then she went up to him, and said, “i dare not say i take you,\\nbut i am yours!” raising her voice that the king might hear, she added,\\n“this is the man!”\\n\\n“bertram,” said the king, “take her; she\\'s your wife!”\\n\\n“my wife, my liege?” said bertram. “i beg your majesty to permit me to\\nchoose a wife.”\\n\\n“do you know, bertram, what she has done for your king?” asked the\\nmonarch, who had treated bertram like a son.\\n\\n“yes, your majesty,” replied bertram; “but why should i marry a girl who\\nowes her breeding to my father\\'s charity?”\\n\\n“you disdain her for lacking a title, but i can give her a title,” said\\nthe king; and as he looked at the sulky youth a thought came to him, and\\nhe added, “strange that you think so much of blood when you could not\\ndistinguish your own from a beggar\\'s if you saw them mixed together in a\\nbowl.”\\n\\n“i cannot love her,” asserted bertram; and helena said gently, “urge\\nhim not, your majesty. i am glad to have cured my king for my country\\'s\\nsake.”\\n\\n“my honor requires that scornful boy\\'s obedience,” said the king.\\n“bertram, make up your mind to this. you marry this lady, of whom you\\nare so unworthy, or you learn how a king can hate. your answer?”\\n\\nbertram bowed low and said, “your majesty has ennobled the lady by your\\ninterest in her. i submit.”\\n\\n“take her by the band,” said the king, “and tell her she is yours.”\\n\\nbertram obeyed, and with little delay he was married to helena.\\n\\nfear of the king, however, could not make him a lover. ridicule helped\\nto sour him. a base soldier named parolles told him to his face that\\nnow he had a “kicky-wicky” his business was not to fight but to stay\\nat home. “kicky-wicky” was only a silly epithet for a wife, but it made\\nbertram feel he could not bear having a wife, and that he must go to the\\nwar in italy, though the king had forbidden him.\\n\\nhelena he ordered to take leave of the king and return to rousillon,\\ngiving her letters for his mother and herself. he then rode off, bidding\\nher a cold good-bye.\\n\\nshe opened the letter addressed to herself, and read, “when you can get\\nthe ring from my finger you can call me husband, but against that \\'when\\'\\ni write \\'never.\\'”\\n\\ndry-eyed had helena been when she entered the king\\'s presence and said\\nfarewell, but he was uneasy on her account, and gave her a ring from\\nhis own finger, saying, “if you send this to me, i shall know you are in\\ntrouble, and help you.”\\n\\nshe did not show him bertram\\'s letter to his wife; it would have made\\nhim wish to kill the truant count; but she went back to rousillon and\\nhanded her mother-in-law the second letter. it was short and bitter. “i\\nhave run away,” it said. “if the world be broad enough, i will be always\\nfar away from her.”\\n\\n“cheer up,” said the noble widow to the deserted wife. “i wash his name\\nout of my blood, and you alone are my child.”\\n\\nthe dowager countess, however, was still mother enough to bertram to lay\\nthe blame of his conduct on parolles, whom she called “a very tainted\\nfellow.”\\n\\nhelena did not stay long at rousillon. she clad herself as a pilgrim,\\nand, leaving a letter for her mother-in-law, secretly set out for\\nflorence.\\n\\non entering that city she inquired of a woman the way to the pilgrims\\'\\nhouse of rest, but the woman begged “the holy pilgrim” to lodge with\\nher.\\n\\nhelena found that her hostess was a widow, who had a beautiful daughter\\nnamed diana.\\n\\nwhen diana heard that helena came from france, she said, “a countryman\\nof yours, count rousillon, has done worthy service for florence.” but\\nafter a time, diana had something to tell which was not at all worthy of\\nhelena\\'s husband. bertram was making love to diana. he did not hide the\\nfact that he was married, but diana heard from parolles that his wife\\nwas not worth caring for.\\n\\nthe widow was anxious for diana\\'s sake, and helena decided to inform her\\nthat she was the countess rousillon.\\n\\n“he keeps asking diana for a lock of her hair,” said the widow.\\n\\nhelena smiled mournfully, for her hair was as fine as diana\\'s and of the\\nsame color. then an idea struck her, and she said, “take this purse of\\ngold for yourself. i will give diana three thousand crowns if she will\\nhelp me to carry out this plan. let her promise to give a lock of her\\nhair to my husband if he will give her the ring which he wears on his\\nfinger. it is an ancestral ring. five counts of rousillon have worn it,\\nyet he will yield it up for a lock of your daughter\\'s hair. let your\\ndaughter insist that he shall cut the lock of hair from her in a dark\\nroom, and agree in advance that she shall not speak a single word.”\\n\\nthe widow listened attentively, with the purse of gold in her lap. she\\nsaid at last, “i consent, if diana is willing.”\\n\\ndiana was willing, and, strange to say, the prospect of cutting off\\na lock of hair from a silent girl in a dark room was so pleasing to\\nbertram that he handed diana his ring, and was told when to follow her\\ninto the dark room. at the time appointed he came with a sharp knife,\\nand felt a sweet face touch his as he cut off the lock of hair, and he\\nleft the room satisfied, like a man who is filled with renown, and on\\nhis finger was a ring which the girl in the dark room had given him.\\n\\nthe war was nearly over, but one of its concluding chapters taught\\nbertram that the soldier who had been impudent enough to call helena his\\n“kicky-wicky” was far less courageous than a wife. parolles was such\\na boaster, and so fond of trimings to his clothes, that the french\\nofficers played him a trick to discover what he was made of. he had lost\\nhis drum, and had said that he would regain it unless he was killed in\\nthe attempt. his attempt was a very poor one, and he was inventing the\\nstory of a heroic failure, when he was surrounded and disarmed.\\n\\n“portotartarossa,” said a french lord.\\n\\n“what horrible lingo is this?” thought parolles, who had been\\nblindfolded.\\n\\n“he\\'s calling for the tortures,” said a french man, affecting to act as\\ninterpreter. “what will you say without \\'em?”\\n\\n“as much,” replied parolles, “as i could possibly say if you pinched me\\nlike a pasty.” he was as good as his word. he told them how many there\\nwere in each regiment of the florentine army, and he refreshed them with\\nspicy anecdotes of the officers commanding it.\\n\\nbertram was present, and heard a letter read, in which parolles told\\ndiana that he was a fool.\\n\\n“this is your devoted friend,” said a french lord.\\n\\n“he is a cat to me now,” said bertram, who detested our hearthrug pets.\\n\\nparolles was finally let go, but henceforth he felt like a sneak, and\\nwas not addicted to boasting.\\n\\nwe now return to france with helena, who had spread a report of her\\ndeath, which was conveyed to the dowager countess at rousillon by lafeu,\\na lord who wished to marry his daughter magdalen to bertram.\\n\\nthe king mourned for helena, but he approved of the marriage proposed\\nfor bertram, and paid a visit to rousillon in order to see it\\naccomplished.\\n\\n“his great offense is dead,” he said. “let bertram approach me.”\\n\\nthen bertram, scarred in the cheek, knelt before his sovereign, and said\\nthat if he had not loved lafeu\\'s daughter before he married helena, he\\nwould have prized his wife, whom he now loved when it was too late.\\n\\n“love that is late offends the great sender,” said the king. “forget\\nsweet helena, and give a ring to magdalen.”\\n\\nbertram immediately gave a ring to lafeu, who said indignantly, “it\\'s\\nhelena\\'s!”\\n\\n“it\\'s not!” said bertram.\\n\\nhereupon the king asked to look at the ring, and said, “this is the ring\\ni gave to helena, and bade her send to me if ever she needed help. so\\nyou had the cunning to get from her what could help her most.”\\n\\nbertram denied again that the ring was helena\\'s, but even his mother\\nsaid it was.\\n\\n“you lie!” exclaimed the king. “seize him, guards!” but even while they\\nwere seizing him, bertram wondered how the ring, which he thought diana\\nhad given him, came to be so like helena\\'s. a gentleman now entered,\\ncraving permission to deliver a petition to the king. it was a petition\\nsigned diana capilet, and it begged that the king would order bertram to\\nmarry her whom he had deserted after winning her love.\\n\\n“i\\'d sooner buy a son-in-law at a fair than take bertram now,” said\\nlafeu.\\n\\n“admit the petitioner,” said the king.\\n\\nbertram found himself confronted by diana and her mother. he denied\\nthat diana had any claim on him, and spoke of her as though her life was\\nspent in the gutter. but she asked him what sort of gentlewoman it\\nwas to whom he gave, as to her he gave, the ring of his ancestors now\\nmissing from his finger?\\n\\nbertram was ready to sink into the earth, but fate had one crowning\\ngenerosity reserved for him. helena entered.\\n\\n“do i see reality?” asked the king.\\n\\n“o pardon! pardon!” cried bertram.\\n\\nshe held up his ancestral ring. “now that i have this,” said she, “will\\nyou love me, bertram?”\\n\\n“to the end of my life,” cried he.\\n\\n“my eyes smell onions,” said lafeu. tears for helena were twinkling in\\nthem.\\n\\nthe king praised diana when he was fully informed by that not very shy\\nyoung lady of the meaning of her

now\\nworthily term’d them merciless to us!                              100\\nfor, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,\\nwe were encounter’d by a mighty rock;\\nwhich being violently borne upon,\\nour helpful ship was splitted in the midst;\\nso that, in this unjust divorce of us,                             105\\nfortune had left to both of us alike\\nwhat to delight in, what to

three were taken up\\nby fishermen of corinth, as we thought.\\nat length, another ship had seized on us;\\nand, knowing whom it was their hap to save,\\ngave healthful welcome to their shipwreck’d guests;                115\\nand would have reft the fishers of their prey,\\nhad not their bark been very slow of sail;\\nand therefore homeward did they bend their course.\\nthus have you heard me

have followed the first\\nfolio. in the subsequent folios it was altered, most probably by an\\naccident in f2 to ‘salinus.’ the name occurs only once in the copies,\\nand that in the first line of the text. the name which we have given as\\n‘antipholus’ is spelt indifferently thus, and ‘antipholis’ in the\\nfolios. it will hardly be doubted that the lines in the rhyming passage,\\niii. 2. 2,\\xa04, where the folios read ‘antipholus,’ are correctly amended\\nby capell, and prove that ‘antipholus’ is the spelling of shakespeare.\\neither word is evidently corrupted from ‘antiphilus.’ these names are\\nmerely arbitrary, but the surnames, ‘erotes’ and ‘sereptus,’ are most\\nprobably errors for ‘errans,’ or ‘erraticus’ and ‘surreptus,’ of which\\nthe latter is plainly derived from plautus’ _menæchmus surreptus_,\\na\\xa0well-known character in shakespeare’s day: see brian melbancke’s\\n_philotimus_ (1582), p.\\xa0160: ‘thou art like menechmus subreptus his wife\\n... whose “husband shall not neede to be justice of peace” for she “will\\nhave a charter to make her justice of coram.”’ see _merry wives_, i.\\xa01.\\n4,\\xa05. in spelling ‘syracusian’ instead of ‘syracusan’ we follow the\\npractice of the folios in an indifferent matter. ‘epidamnum’ not\\n‘epidamium’ is found in the english translation of the _menæchmi_,\\n1595, so the latter form in f1 is probably a printer’s error.\\n\\n\\nnote ii.\\n\\ni. 2. 1. that this scene is laid at the mart appears from antipholus’s\\nallusion to this place in ii. 2. 5,\\xa06:\\n\\n  ‘i could not speak with dromio since at first\\n   i sent him from the mart.’\\n\\nas this play is derived from a classical prototype, capell has supposed\\nno change of scene, but lays the whole action in ‘a publick place;’\\nevidently with much inconvenience to the persons.\\n\\n\\nnote iii.\\n\\nii. 1. 30. johnson’s ingenious conjecture may have been suggested to him\\nby a passage in _as you like it_, iv. 3. 17:\\n\\n  ‘her love is not the hare that i do hunt.’\\n\\nbut the received reading of the folios is perhaps confirmed by a line in\\nthe present play, iii. 2. 7:\\n\\n  ‘or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth.’\\n\\n\\nnote iv.\\n\\nii. 1. 108 sqq. the only correction of this passage which we believe to\\nbe quite free from doubt is that in line 112, ‘wear’ for ‘where.’\\naccordingly, with this exception, we have retained the precise words of\\nthe first folio.\\n\\n\\nnote v.\\n\\niv. 2. 38. grey’s conjecture of ‘lanes’ for ‘lands’ is made somewhat\\nmore probable by the existence of copies of f1 in which the word\\nappears ‘lans.’ a\\xa0corrector would naturally change this rather to\\n‘lands’ than to ‘lanes,’ because of the rhyme.\\n\\n\\nnote vi.\\n\\niv. 2. 46. the folios have ‘send him mistris redemption,’ and rowe, by\\nhis punctuation and capital r, made dromio call luciana ‘redemption.’\\npope and theobald seem to have followed him, though they give the small\\nr. the folios cannot be made chargeable with this error, for the comma\\ndoes not regularly follow vocatives in these editions where we expect\\nit. there is no comma, for instance, following the word ‘mistress’ in\\niv. 3. 75 or in iv. 4. 39.\\n\\n\\nnote vii.\\n\\niv. 4. 29. the word ‘ears’ might probably be better printed ‘’ears’ for\\n‘years;’ for a pun--hitherto, however, unnoticed--seems to be indicated\\nby the following words. a\\xa0very farfetched explanation has been offered\\nby steevens, and accepted by delius and, we believe, by all the modern\\neditors, namely, that antipholus has wrung dromio’s ears so often that\\nthey have attained a length like an ass’s.\\n\\n\\nnote viii.\\n\\nv. 1. 1. shakespeare uses the words ‘priory’ and ‘abbey’ as synonymous.\\ncompare v. 1. 37 and v. 1. 122.\\n\\n\\nnote ix.\\n\\nv. 1. 235. it might possibly be better to print this line as two lines,\\nthe first being broken:\\n\\n  ‘by the way we met\\n   my wife....’\\n\\nbut the place is probably corrupt.\\n\\n\\nnote x.\\n\\nv. 1. 399. the number thirty-three has been altered by editors to bring\\nthe figures into harmony with other periods named in the play. from\\ni.\\xa01. 126, 133 the age of antipholus has been computed at twenty-three;\\nfrom i.\\xa01. 126 and v.\\xa01. 308 we derive twenty-five. the duke says he has\\nbeen patron to antipholus for twenty years, v.\\xa01. 325; but three or five\\nseems too small an age to assign for the commencement of this patronage.\\nantipholus saved the duke’s life in the wars ‘long since,’ v.\\xa01. 161,\\n191. his ‘long experience’ of his wife’s ‘wisdom’ and her ‘years’ are\\nmentioned, iii. 1. 89, 90. but shakespeare probably did not compute the\\nresult of his own figures with any great care or accuracy.\\n\\n

library\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npreface\\n\\n\\nthe text of this edition of _julius cæsar_ is based upon a collation of\\nthe seventeenth century folios, the globe edition, and that of delius.\\nas compared with the text of the earlier editions of hudson\\'s\\nshakespeare, it is conservative. exclusive of changes in spelling,\\npunctuation, and stage directions, very few emendations by eighteenth\\ncentury and nineteenth century editors have been adopted; and these,\\nwith every variation from the first folio, are indicated in the textual\\nnotes. these notes are printed immediately below the text so that a\\nreader or student may see at a glance the evidence in the case of a\\ndisputed reading and have some definite understanding of the reasons for\\nthose differences in the text of shakespeare which frequently surprise\\nand very often annoy. a consideration of the more poetical, or the more\\ndramatically effective, of two variant readings will often lead to rich\\nresults in awakening a spirit of discriminating interpretation and in\\ndeveloping true creative criticism. in no sense is this a textual\\nvariorum edition. the variants given are only those of importance and\\nhigh authority.\\n\\nthe spelling and the punctuation of the text are modern, except in the\\ncase of verb terminations in _-ed_, which, when the _e_ is silent, are\\nprinted with the apostrophe in its place. this is the general usage in\\nthe first folio. modern spelling has to a certain extent been followed\\nin the text variants; but the original spelling has been retained\\nwherever its peculiarities have been the basis for important textual\\ncriticism and emendation.\\n\\nwith the exception of the position of the textual variants, the plan of\\nthis edition is similar to that of the old hudson shakespeare. it is\\nimpossible to specify the various instances of revision and\\nrearrangement in the matter of the introduction and the interpretative\\nnotes, but the endeavor has been to retain all that gave the old edition\\nits unique place and to add the results of what seems vital and\\npermanent in later inquiry and research.\\n\\nwhile it is important that the principle of _suum cuique_ be attended to\\nso far as is possible in matters of research and scholarship, it is\\nbecoming more and more difficult to give every man his own in\\nshakespearian annotation. the amount of material accumulated is so great\\nthat the identity-origin of much important comment and suggestion is\\neither wholly lost or so crushed out of shape as to be beyond\\nrecognition. instructive significance perhaps attaches to this in\\nediting the works of one who quietly made so much of materials gathered\\nby others. but the list of authorities given on page li will indicate\\nthe chief source of much that has gone to enrich the value of this\\nedition. professor w. p. trent, of columbia university, has offered\\nvaluable suggestions and given important advice; and to mr. m. grant\\ndaniell\\'s patience, accuracy, and judgment this volume owes both its\\nfreedom from many a blunder and its possession of a carefully arranged\\nindex.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncontents\\n\\n\\nintroduction\\n\\n                                            page\\n\\ni. sources                                   vii\\n\\n    the main story

event in the history of the world has made a more profound impression\\nupon the popular imagination than the assassination of julius cæsar.\\napart from its overwhelming interest as a personal catastrophe, it was\\nregarded in the sixteenth century as a happening of the greatest\\nhistorical moment, fraught with significant public lessons for all time.\\nthere is ample evidence that in england from the beginning of\\nelizabeth\\'s reign it was the subject of much literary and dramatic\\ntreatment, and in making the murder of \"the mightiest julius\" the climax\\nof a play, shakespeare was true to that instinct which drew him for\\nmaterial to themes of universal and eternal interest.\\n\\n\\nthe main story\\n\\ni. _north\\'s plutarch._ there is no possible doubt that in _julius cæsar_\\nshakespeare derived the great body of his historical material from _the\\nlife of julius cæsar_, _the life of marcus brutus_, and _the life of\\nmarcus antonius_ in sir thomas north\\'s translation of plutarch.[1] this\\nwork was first printed in 1579 in a massive folio dedicated to queen\\nelizabeth. a second edition appeared in 1595, and in all probability\\nthis was the edition read by shakespeare. the title-page is reproduced\\nin facsimile on page ix. this interesting title-page gives in brief the\\nliterary history of north\\'s translation, which was made not directly\\nfrom the original greek of plutarch, but from a french version by\\njacques amyot, bishop of auxerre.[2] in 1603 appeared a third edition\\nwith additional _lives_ and new matter on the title-page.[3] there were\\nsubsequent editions in 1612,[4] 1631, 1656, and 1676. the popularity of\\nthis work attested by these reprintings was thoroughly deserved, for\\nnorth\\'s plutarch is among the richest and freshest monuments of\\nelizabethan prose literature, and, apart altogether from the use made of\\nit by shakespeare, is in itself an invaluable repertory of honest,\\nmanly, idiomatic english. no abstract of the plutarchian matter need be\\ngiven here, as all the more important passages drawn upon for the play\\nare quoted in the footnotes to the text. these will show that in most of\\nthe leading incidents the great greek biographer is closely followed,\\nthough in many cases these incidents are worked out and developed with\\nrare fertility of invention and art. it is very significant that in the\\nsecond half of _the life of julius cæsar_, which shakespeare draws upon\\nvery heavily, plutarch emphasizes those weaknesses of cæsar which are\\nmade so prominent in the play. besides this, in many places the\\nplutarchian form and order of thought, and also the very words of\\nnorth\\'s racy and delectable english are retained, with such an embalming\\nfor immortality as shakespeare alone could give.[5]\\n\\n[footnote 1: professor w. w. skeat\\'s _shakespeare\\'s plutarch_ (the\\nmacmillan company) gives these _lives_ in convenient form with a text\\nbased upon the edition of 1612.]\\n\\n[footnote 2: a latin translation of plutarch\\'s _lives_ was printed at\\nrome as early as 1470, and there is evidence that through a latin\\nversion the work first attracted the attention of amyot. but his famous\\nfrench version, first published in 1559, shows thorough familiarity with\\nthe original greek text.]\\n\\n[footnote 3: this title-page is

quotation from plutarch given in the note, p. 68, l.\\n33, this account of the same incident in appian: \"the day before that\\ncæsar should go to the senate, he had him at a banquet with lepidus ...\\nand talking merrily what death was best for a man, some saying one and\\nsome another, he of all praised sudden death.\" here are some of the\\nmarginal summaries in appian: \"cæsar refuseth the name of king,\" \"a\\ncrown upon cæsar\\'s image by one that was apprehended of the tribunes\\nmarullus and sitius,\" \"cæsar hath the falling-sickness,\" \"cæsar\\'s wife\\n(hath) a fearful dream,\" \"cæsar contemneth sacrifices of evil luck,\"\\n\"cæsar giveth over when brutus had stricken him,\" \"the fear of the\\nconspirators,\" \"the bad angel of brutus.\"\\n\\nwhat gives interest and distinction to appian\\'s translation as a\\nprobable source for material in _julius cæsar_ is that in it we have\\nspeeches by antony, brutus, and lepidus at the time of the reading of\\ncæsar\\'s will. in this translation antony\\'s first speech begins, \"they\\nthat would have voices tried upon cæsar must know afore that if he\\nruled as an officer lawfully chosen, then all his acts and decrees must\\nstand in force....\" on antony\\'s second speech the comment is, \"thus\\nwrought antony artificially.\" his speech to the senate begins, \"silence\\nbeing commanded, he said thus, \\'of the citizens offenders (you men of\\nequal honour) in this your consultation i have said nothing....\\'\" the\\nspeech of lepidus to the people has this setting: \"when he was come to\\nthe place of speech he lamented, weeping, and thus said, \\'here i was\\nyesterday with cæsar, and now am i here to inquire of cæsar\\'s death....\\ncæsar is gone from us, an holy and honourable man in deed.\\'\" the effect\\nof this speech is commented on as follows: \"handling the matter thus\\ncraftily, the hired men, knowing that he was ambitious, praised him and\\nexhorted him to take the office of cæsar\\'s priesthood.\" a long speech by\\nbrutus follows the reading of cæsar\\'s will. it begins: \"now, o citizens,\\nwe be here with you that yesterday were in the common court not as men\\nfleeing to the temple that have done amiss, nor as to a fort, having\\ncommitted all we have to you.... we have heard what hath been objected\\nagainst us of our enemies, touching the oath and touching cause of\\ndoubt....\" the effect of this speech is thus described: \"whiles brutus\\nthus spake, all the hearers considering with themselves that he spake\\nnothing but right, did like them well, and as men of courage and lovers\\nof the people, had them in great admiration and were turned into their\\nfavour.\"\\n\\n3. _earlier plays._ as already mentioned, england had plays on the\\nsubject of julius cæsar from the first years of elizabeth\\'s reign. as\\nnot one of these earlier plays is extant, there can be no certainty as\\nto whether shakespeare drew upon them for materials or inspiration, but,\\nas professor herford says, \"he seems to be cognisant of their\\nexistence.\" his opening scene is addressed to a public familiar with the\\nhistory of pompey and pompey\\'s sons. among these earlier plays was one\\nalmost contemporary with the first production of _gorboduc_, the first\\nenglish tragedy. it is referred to under the name of _julyus sesar_ in\\nan entry in machyn\\'s _diary_ under february 1, 1562. in _plays confuted\\nin five actions_, printed probably in 1582, stephen gosson mentions the\\nhistory of _cæsar and pompey_ as a contemporary play. a latin play on\\ncæsar\\'s death was acted at oxford in 1582, and for it dr. richard eedes\\n(eades, edes) of christ church wrote the epilogue (_epilogus cæsaris\\nintersecti_). in henslowe\\'s _diary_ under november 8, 1594, a _seser and\\npompie_ is mentioned as a new play. mr. a. w. verity (_julius cæsar_,\\nthe pitt press edition) makes the interesting suggestion that in iii, i,\\n111-116, there may be an allusion to these earlier plays. cf. also\\n_hamlet_, iii, ii, 107-111, quoted below.\\n\\n\\nthe scene of the assassination\\n\\nin transferring the assassination of cæsar from the _porticus pompeia_\\n(\"pompey\\'s porch,\" i, iii, 126) to the capitol, shakespeare departed\\nfrom plutarch and historical accuracy to follow a popular tradition that\\nhad received the signal imprimatur of chaucer:\\n\\n  this iulius to the capitolie wente\\n  upon a day, as he was wont to goon,[1]\\n  and in the capitolie anon him hente[2]\\n  this false brutus, and his othere foon[3]\\n  and stikede him with boydekins[4] anoon\\n  with many a wounde, and thus they lete him lye;\\n  but never gronte[5] he at no strook but oon,\\n  or elles at two, but if[6] his storie lye.\\n\\n        _the monkes tale_, ll. 715-718.

[ii, vi, 12-19.]\\n\\nwe have the same popular tradition in the first scene of the last act of\\nfletcher\\'s _the noble gentleman_. so, too, in the prologue to beaumont\\nand fletcher\\'s, or fletcher and massinger\\'s, _the false one_, a tragedy\\ndealing with cæsar and cleopatra:\\n\\n                          to tell\\n  of cæsar\\'s amorous heats, and how he fell\\n  i\\' the capitol.\\n\\nhere the reference is to shakespeare\\'s play.\\n\\n\\n\"et tu, brute\"\\n\\ndyce and other researchers have made clear that in shakespeare\\'s day\\n\"_et tu, brute_\" was a familiar phrase which had special reference to a\\nwound from a supposed friend. it probably owed its popularity to having\\nbeen used in the earlier plays on the subject of julius cæsar. in _the\\ntrue tragedie of richard duke of york_ (1595), upon which shakespeare\\'s\\n_3 henry vi_ is based, occurs the line,\\n\\n  _et tu, brute?_ wilt thou stab cæsar too?\\n\\nthis line is repeated in s. nicholson\\'s poem, _acolastus, his\\nafterwitte_ (1600). in ben jonson\\'s _every man out of his humour_\\n(1599), buffone uses \"_et tu, brute_\" in speaking to macilente (v, iv).\\nin the _myrroure for magistrates_ (1587) we find,\\n\\n  and brutus thou, my sonne, quoth i, whom erst i loved best.\\n\\nthe latin form of the phrase possibly originated, as malone suggested,\\nin the latin play referred to above (earlier plays) which was acted at\\noxford in 1582. it is easy to see how the elizabethan tendency to\\nword-quibble and equivoque would help to give currency to the latin\\nform. cf. hamlet\\'s joke on \\'brute\\' quoted above.\\n\\n\\nbrutus\\'s speech, iii, ii\\n\\nin view of the close connection between _julius cæsar_ and _hamlet_ as\\nregards date of composition and the characterization of brutus and\\nhamlet, interest attaches to professor gollancz\\'s theory (_julius\\ncæsar_, temple shakespeare) that the original of the famous speech of\\nbrutus to the assembled romans (iii, ii) may be found in belleforest\\'s\\n_history of hamlet_, in the oration which hamlet makes to the danes\\nafter he has slain his uncle. \"the situation of hamlet is almost\\nidentical with that of brutus after he has dealt the blow, and the\\nburden of hamlet\\'s too lengthy speech finds an echo in brutus\\'s\\nsententious utterance. the verbose iteration of the dane has been\\ncompressed to suit \\'the brief compendious manner of speech of the\\nlacedæmonians.\\'\"--gollancz. as the english translation from which\\nprofessor gollancz quotes in support of his theory is dated 1608, and is\\nthe earliest known,[1] it cannot have been from this that shakespeare\\ndrew any suggestions or material. the question arises, did shakespeare\\nread the speech in the original french? the volume of belleforest\\'s\\n_histoires tragiques_, which contained the story of hamlet, was first\\npublished in 1570, and there were many reprintings of it before 1600.\\n\\n[footnote 1: reprinted in collier\\'s _shakespeare\\'s library_. this\\ntranslation shows in more than one place the influence of shakespeare\\'s\\nplay. for example, hamlet\\'s exclamation before he kills polonius, \"a\\nrat! a rat!\" is in the english version, but there is no suggestion of it\\nin the french original.]\\n\\n\\nii. date of composition\\n\\nmodern editors fix the date of composition of _julius cæsar_ within\\n1601, the later time limit (_terminus ante quem_), and 1598, the earlier\\ntime limit (_terminus post quem_). the weight of evidence is in favor of\\n1600-1601.\\n\\n\\nexternal evidence\\n\\n1. _negative._ _julius cæsar_ is not mentioned by meres in the _palladis\\ntamia_, published in 1598, which gives a list of twelve noteworthy\\nshakespeare plays in existence at that time. this establishes 1598 as a\\nprobable _terminus post quem_.\\n\\n2. _positive._ in john weever\\'s _mirror of martyrs or the life and death\\nof sir john oldcastle knight, lord cobham_, printed in 1601, are the\\nfollowing lines:\\n\\n  the many-headed multitude were drawne\\n  by _brutus_ speech that _cæsar_ was ambitious,\\n  when eloquent _mark antonie_ had showne\\n  his vertues, who but _brutus_ then was vicious?\\n      man\\'s memorie, with new, forgets the old,\\n      one tale is good, until another\\'s told.\\n\\nhalliwell-phillipps was the first to note that here is a very pointed\\nreference to the second scene of the third act of _julius cæsar_, as the\\nantithesis brought out is not indicated in any of shakespeare\\'s\\nhistorical sources. the fact that weever states in his dedication that\\nthe _mirror_ \"some two years agoe was made fit for the print\" has been\\nheld by mr. percy simpson[1] to indicate that the play was not brought\\nout later than 1599, a conclusion supported, he thinks, by a passage in\\nben jonson\\'s _every man out of his humour_, produced in that year, where\\nclove (iii, i) says, \"then coming to the pretty animal, as _reason long\\nsince is fled to animals_, you know,\" which may be a sneering allusion\\nto antony\\'s \"o judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts\" (iii, ii,\\n104). the \"_et tu, brute_\" quotation in the same play has been used to\\nstrengthen the argument. but the lines from the _mirror of martyrs_\\nquoted above may easily have been inserted by weever into his poem in\\nconsequence of the popularity of shakespeare\\'s play. this contemporary\\npopularity is well attested. leonard digges,[2] in his verses _upon\\nmaster william shakespeare_ prefixed to the 1640 edition of\\nshakespeare\\'s poems, thus compares it with that of ben jonson\\'s roman\\nplays:\\n\\n  so have i seene, when cesar would appeare,\\n  and on the stage at halfe-sword parley were\\n  _brutus_ and _cassius_: oh how the audience\\n  were ravish\\'d, with what new wonder they went thence,\\n  when some new day they would not brooke a line\\n  of tedious (though well laboured) _catiline_;\\n  _sejanus_ too was irkesome, they priz\\'de more\\n  honest _iago_, or the jealous _moore_.\\n\\n[footnote 1: in _notes and queries_, february, 1899.]\\n\\n[footnote 2: leonard digges also wrote verses \"to the memorie of the\\ndeceased authour maister w. shakespeare,\" prefixed to the first folio.]\\n\\n\"fustian\" clove\\'s quotation may apply to references to the pythagorean\\ndoctrine of the transmigration of souls in shakespeare\\'s earlier plays\\nand other elizabethan literature; and little can be based upon the \"_et\\ntu, brute_\" quotation, as ben jonson may have drawn it from the same\\nsource as shakespeare did.\\n\\non the other hand, henslowe in his _diary_ under may 22, 1602, notes\\nthat he advanced five pounds \"in earneste of a boocke called _sesers\\nfalle_,\" which the dramatists munday, drayton, webster, middleton \"and\\nthe rest\" were composing for lord nottingham\\'s company. _cæsar\\'s fall_\\nwas plainly intended to outshine shakespeare\\'s popular play, but, as\\nprofessor herford comments, \"the lost play ... for the rival company\\nwould have been a somewhat tardy counterblast to an old piece of 1599.\"\\nhe adds: \"_julius cæsar_ was certainly not unconcerned in the revival of\\nthe fashion for tragedies of revenge with a ghost in them, which\\nsuddenly set in with marston\\'s _antonio and mellida_ and chettle\\'s\\n_hoffman_ in 1601.\"\\n\\ndr. furnivall, a strong advocate for 1601 as the date of composition,\\nhas suggested[1] that essex\\'s ill-judged rebellion against queen\\nelizabeth, on sunday, february 8, 1601, was the reason of shakespeare\\'s\\nproducing his _julius cæsar_ in that year. \"assuredly,\" he says, \"the\\ncitizens of london in that year who heard shakespeare\\'s play must have\\nfelt the force of \\'_et tu, brute_,\\' and must have seen brutus\\'s death,\\nwith keener and more home-felt influence than we feel and hear the\\nthings with now.\"\\n\\ndrayton\\'s revised version of his _mortimeriados_ (1596-1597); published\\nin 1603 under the title of _the barons\\' wars_, has a passage which\\nstrongly resembles some lines in antony\\'s last speech (v, v, 73-74), but\\ncommon property in the idea that a well-balanced mixture of the four\\nelements (earth, air, fire, and water) produces a perfect man\\ninvalidates any argument for the date of the play based upon this\\nevidence. see note, p. 167, l. 73.\\n\\n\\ninternal evidence\\n\\ndr. w. a. wright[2] has argued against an earlier date than 1600 for the\\ncomposition of _julius caesar_ from the use of \\'eternal\\' for \\'infernal\\'\\nin i, ii, 160. see note, p. 20, l. 160. of course there is no certainty\\nthat shakespeare wished to use the word \\'infernal,\\' and, besides, if\\nany substitution was made, it may have been at a later date. but\\nadumbrations of _hamlet_ everywhere in _julius cæsar_, the frequent\\nreferences to cæsar in _hamlet_, the kinship in character of brutus and\\nhamlet (see note, p. 46, l. 65), the treatment of the supernatural, and\\nthe development of the revenge motive give strong cumulative evidence\\nthat the composition of _julius cæsar_ is in time very near to that of\\n_hamlet_, the first shakespearian draft of which is now generally\\nconceded to date from the first months of 1602. the diction of _julius\\ncæsar_, the quality of the blank verse, the style generally (see below,\\nversification and diction), all point to 1601 as the probable date of\\ncomposition. it has been said that a true taste for shakespeare is like\\nthe creation of a special sense; and this saying is nowhere better\\napproved than in reference to his subtile variations of language and\\nstyle. he began with what may be described as a preponderance of the\\npoetic element over the dramatic. as we trace his course onward, we may\\ndiscover a gradual rising of the latter element into greater strength\\nand prominence, until at last it had the former in complete subjection.\\nnow, where positive external evidence is wanting, it is mainly from the\\nrelative strength of these elements that the probable date of the\\nwriting may be argued. in _julius cæsar_ the diction is more gliding and\\ncontinuous, and the imagery more round and amplified, than in the\\nearlier dramas or in those known to belong to shakespeare\\'s latest\\nperiod.\\n\\n[footnote 1: in _the academy_, september 18, 1875. see also _the leopold\\nshakspere_, introduction.]\\n\\n[footnote 2: _julius cæsar_, the clarendon press, introduction, p.\\nviii.]\\n\\nthese distinctive notes are of a nature more easily to be felt than\\ndescribed, and to make them felt examples will best serve. take then a\\npassage from the soliloquy of brutus just after he has pledged himself\\nto the conspiracy:\\n\\n                     \\'tis a common proof,\\n  that lowliness is young ambition\\'s ladder,\\n  whereto the climber upward turns his face;\\n  but when he once attains the upmost round,\\n  he then unto the ladder turns his back,\\n  looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\\n  by which he did ascend.

and it is true in a still deeper sense afterwards, since his\\ngenius then becomes the nemesis or retributive providence.\\n\\n\\nv. dramatic construction and development\\n\\n_julius cæsar_ is a tragedy of a normal shakespearian type, in which is\\nrepresented a conflict between an individual, or group of individuals,\\nand certain forces which environ, antagonize, and overwhelm. the unity\\nof action and of interest is the personality of julius cæsar. in\\ndramatic technique the play is simple and effective. out of masses of\\ndetail and historical incident the dramatist has shaped a symmetrical\\nand well-defined plot marked by (1) the exposition, or introduction, (2)\\nthe complication, or rising action, (3) the climax, or turning point,\\n(4) the resolution, or falling action, and (5) the catastrophe, or\\nconclusion. it is almost a commonplace of criticism that the opening\\nscene of a shakespeare play strikes the keynote of the action. it\\ncertainly does in a remarkable way in _julius cæsar_, introducing, on\\nthe one side, a group of excited citizens friendly to cæsar, and, on the\\nother, two tribunes hostile to him. it foreshadows the\\ncharacter-contrasts in the play and the conflict between the state and\\nthe individual. the exposition continues through the second scene, in\\nwhich are introduced the leading characters in significant action and\\ninteraction. at the close of this scene cassius lays his plans to win\\nbrutus over to the conspiracy, and the complication, or rising action,\\nof the drama begins. through the last scene of the first act and the\\nfour scenes of the second act the growth of the complication is\\ncontinued, with brief intervals of suspense, until, in the first scene\\nof the third act, the climax is reached in the assassination of cæsar\\nand the wild enthusiasm of the conspirators. with the entry of antony\\'s\\nservant begins the resolution, or falling action (see note, p. 89, l.\\n123), and from now, through intervals of long suspense and many\\nvicissitudes,[1] the fortunes of the chief conspirators fall inevitably\\nto the catastrophe.\\n\\n\\nanalysis by act and scene[2]\\n\\n[footnote 1: for an interesting defense of the so-called \\'dragging\\'\\ntendency and episodical character of the third scene of the fourth act,\\nsee professor a. c. bradley\\'s _shakespearean tragedy_, pp. 55-61.]\\n\\n[footnote 2: \"it must be understood that a play can be analyzed into\\nvery different schemes of plot. it must not be thought that one of these\\nschemes is right and the rest wrong;

it is at the same time the\\nemotional crisis from which brutus comes with altered destiny.\\n\\n\\niv. the resolution, falling action, or consequence (the untying of the\\nknot)\\n\\n_act iii, scene i, 123-298._ with brutus\\'s \"soft! who comes here? a\\nfriend of antony\\'s\" begins the resolution, or falling action, of the\\nplay. \"the fortune of the conspirators, hitherto in the ascendant, now\\ndeclines, while \\'cæsar\\'s spirit\\' surely and steadily prevails against\\nthem.\"--verity. against the advice of cassius, brutus gives antony\\npermission to deliver a public funeral oration. antony in a soliloquy\\nshows his determination to avenge cæsar, and the first scene of the\\nfalling action closes with the announcement that octavius is within\\nseven leagues of rome.\\n\\n_act iii, scene ii--scene iii._ the orations of antony, in vivid\\ncontrast to the conciliatory but unimpassioned speeches of brutus, fire\\nthe people and liberate fresh forces in the falling action. brutus and\\ncassius have to fly the city, riding \"like madmen through the gates of\\nrome.\" in unreasoning fury the mob tears to pieces an innocent poet who\\nhas the same name as a conspirator.\\n\\n_act iv, scene i._ antony, octavius, and lepidus, having formed a\\ntriumvirate of which antony is the master spirit, agree on a\\nproscription list and join forces against brutus and cassius, who \"are\\nlevying powers.\"\\n\\n_act iv, scene ii._ brutus and cassius, long parted by pride and\\nobstinacy, meet to discuss a plan of action.\\n\\n_act iv, scene iii._ this is one of the most famous individual scenes in\\nshakespeare (see note, page 123). its intensely human interest is always\\nconceded, but its dramatic propriety, because of what seems a \\'dragging\\'\\ntendency, has been often questioned. the scene opens with brutus and\\ncassius bandying recriminations, and the quarrel of the two generals\\nbodes disaster to their cause. as the discussion proceeds, they yield\\npoints and become reconciled. brutus then quietly but with peculiar\\npathos tells of portia\\'s death by her own hand. in all the great\\ntragedies, with the notable exception of _othello_, when the forces of\\nthe resolution, or falling action, are gathering towards the dénouement,\\nshakespeare introduces a scene which appeals to an emotion different\\nfrom any of those excited elsewhere in the play. \"as a rule this new\\nemotion is pathetic; and the pathos is not terrible or lacerating, but,\\neven if painful, is accompanied by the sense of beauty and by an outflow\\nof admiration or affection, which come with an inexpressible sweetness\\nafter the tension of the crisis and the first counter-stroke. so it is\\nwith the reconciliation of brutus and cassius, and the arrival of the\\nnews of portia\\'s death.\"--bradley. while the shadow of her tragic\\npassing overhangs the spirits of both, brutus overhears the shrewd,\\ncautious counsel of cassius and persuades him to assent to the fatal\\npolicy of offering battle at philippi. that night the ghost of cæsar\\nappears to brutus.\\n\\n_act v, scene i._ the action now falls rapidly to the quick, decisive\\nmovement of the dénouement. the antagonists are now face to face. brutus\\nand cassius have done what antony and octavius hoped that they would do.\\nthe opposing generals hold a brief parley in which brutus intimates that\\nhe is willing to effect a reconciliation, but antony rejects his\\nproposals and bluntly charges him and cassius with the wilful murder of\\ncæsar. cassius reminds brutus of his warning that antony should have\\nfallen when cæsar did. antony, octavius, and their army retire, and the\\nscene closes with the noble farewell without hope between brutus and\\ncassius.\\n\\n_act v, scene ii._ the opposing armies meet on the field, and a final\\nflare-up of hope in the breast of brutus is indicated by his spirited\\norder to messala to charge. the scene implies that cassius was defeated\\nby being left without support by brutus.\\n\\n\\nv. dénouement, catastrophe, or conclusion (the knot untied)\\n\\n_act v, scene iii._ the charge ordered by brutus has been successful,\\nand octavius has been driven back, but cassius is thus left unguarded,\\nand antony\\'s forces surround him. he takes refuge on a hill and sends\\ntitinius to see \"whether yond troops are friend or enemy.\" believing\\ntitinius to be slain, he begs pindarus to stab him, and cassius dies\\n\"even with the sword that kill\\'d\" cæsar. with the same sword titinius\\nthen slays himself, and brutus, when messala bears the news to him,\\nexclaims in words that strike the keynote of the whole falling action\\nand dénouement:\\n\\n  o julius cæsar, thou art mighty yet!\\n  thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords\\n  in our own proper entrails.\\n\\n_act v, scene iv._ like hamlet, brutus at the last is a man of supreme\\naction. he rallies his forces for a last attack. with hopeless failure\\nbefore him, he is at once a heroic figure and one of infinite pathos.\\nyoung cato falls. lucilius is attacked; assuming the name of brutus, he\\nis not killed but taken prisoner. antony recognizes him and gives orders\\nthat he be treated kindly.\\n\\n_act v, scene v._ brutus dies by his own sword, and his last words tell\\nthe story of failure and defeat. like a true roman, he meets his doom\\nwithout a murmur of complaint. he had been true to his ideals. the\\ntragic dénouement comes as the inevitable consequence, not of wilful\\nsin, but of a noble mistake. in death he commands the veneration of both\\nantony and octavius, who pronounce over his body the great\\ninterpretation of his character, and in their speeches the tragedy\\ncloses as with a chant of victory for the hero of defeat.\\n\\n\\nvi. management of time and place\\n\\n1. _historic time._ cæsar\\'s triumph over the sons of pompey was\\ncelebrated in october, b.c. 45. shakespeare makes this coincident with\\n\"the feast of lupercal\" on february 15, b.c. 44. in the play antony\\ndelivers his funeral oration immediately after cæsar\\'s death;\\nhistorically, there was an interval of days. octavius did not reach rome\\nuntil upwards of two months after the assassination; in iii, ii, 261,\\nantony is told by his servant immediately after the funeral oration that\\n\"octavius is already come to rome.\" in november, b.c. 43, the triumvirs\\nmet to make up their bloody proscription, and in the autumn of the\\nfollowing year were fought the two battles of philippi, separated\\nhistorically by twenty days, but represented by shakespeare as taking\\nplace on the same day.\\n\\n2. _dramatic time._ historical happenings that extended over nearly\\nthree years are represented in the stage action as the occurrences of\\nsix days, distributed over the acts and scenes as follows:\\n\\n  day 1.--i, i, ii.\\n      interval.\\n  day 2.--i, iii.\\n  day 3.--ii, iii.\\n      interval.\\n  day 4.--iv, i.\\n      interval.\\n  day 5.--iv, ii, iii.\\n      interval.\\n  day 6.--v.\\n\\nthis compression for the purposes of dramatic unity results in action\\nthat is swift and throbbing with human and ethical interest.\\n\\n3. _place._ up to the second scene of the fourth act rome is the natural\\nplace of action. the second and third scenes of the fourth act are at\\nsardis in asia minor; the last act shifts to philippi in macedonia. the\\nonly noteworthy deviation from historical accuracy is in making the\\nconference of the triumvirs take place at rome and not at bononia. see\\nnote, p. 116. but there is peculiar dramatic effectiveness in placing\\nthis fateful colloquy in the city that was the center of the political\\nunrest of the time.\\n\\n\\nvii. versification and diction\\n\\nblank verse\\n\\nthe characteristics of shakespeare\\'s blank verse--the rhymeless, iambic\\nfive-stress (decasyllabic) verse, or iambic pentameter, introduced into\\nengland by henry howard, earl of surrey, about 1540--and its proportion\\nto rhyme and to prose have been much used in recent years to determine\\nthe chronological order of the plays and the development of the poet\\'s\\nart. in blank verse as used by shakespeare we have really an epitome of\\nthe development of the measure in connection with the english drama. in\\nhis earlier plays the blank verse is often similar to that of\\n_gorboduc_, the first english tragedy. the tendency is to adhere to the\\nsyllable-counting principle, to make the line the unit, the sentence and\\nphrase coinciding with the line (end-stopped verse), and to use five\\nperfect iambic feet to the line. in plays of the middle period, such as\\n_the merchant of venice_ and _as you like it_, written between 1596 and\\n1600, the blank verse is more like that of kyd and marlowe, with less\\nmonotonous regularity in the structure and an increasing tendency to\\ncarry on the sense from one line to another without a syntactical or\\nrhetorical pause at the end of the line (run-on verse, _enjambement_).\\nredundant syllables now abound and the melody is richer and fuller. in\\nshakespeare\\'s later plays the blank verse breaks away from all bondage\\nto formal line limits, and the organic continuity is found in a\\nsuccession of great metrical periods.\\n\\nthe verse of _julius cæsar_ is less monotonously regular than that of\\nthe earlier plays; it is more flexible and varied, more musical and\\nsonorous, but it lacks the superb movement of the verse in _othello_,\\n_the winter\\'s tale_, and _the tempest_. end-stopped, normally regular\\niambic pentameter lines often occur (as, for instance, i, i, 37, 41, 44,\\n62, 76), but everywhere are variations and deviations from the norm, and\\nthere is an unusual number of short lines and interjectional lines of\\ntwo or three stresses. see abbott\\'s _a shakespearian grammar_, §§ 511,\\n512.\\n\\n\\nrhyme\\n\\napart from the use of rhyme in songs, lyrics, and portions of masques\\n(as in _the tempest_, iv, i, 60-138), a progress from more to less rhyme\\nis a sure index to shakespeare\\'s development as a dramatist and a master\\nof expression. in the early _love\\'s labour\\'s lost_ are more than one\\nthousand rhyming five-stress iambic lines; in _the tempest_ are only\\ntwo; in _the winter\\'s tale_ not one. _in julius cæsar_ are found only\\nthirty-four rhyming lines.\\n\\n\\nprose\\n\\nif \"of the soule the bodie forme doth take,\" it is small wonder that\\nattempts have been made to explain shakespeare\\'s distinctive use of\\nverse and prose. of recent years there have been interesting discussions\\nof the question \"whether we are justified in supposing that shakespeare\\nwas guided by any fixed principle in his employment of verse and prose,\\nor whether he merely employed them, as fancy suggested, for the sake of\\nvariety and relief.\"[1] it is a significant fact that in many of\\nshakespeare\\'s earlier plays there is little or no prose, and that the\\nproportion of prose to blank verse increases with the decrease of rhyme.\\nin _julius cæsar_ three kinds of prose may be distinguished: (1) the\\nprose of homely dialogue, as in the talk of the common people in i, i,\\nand iii, iii. (2) the prose of serious information as to the nature of a\\nsituation, as in casca\\'s description of the offer of the crown to cæsar.\\nthis kind of prose reaches its highest development in brutus\\'s famous\\nspeech, iii, ii, with its dignified defense and laconic exposition of\\nhis honesty of purpose. (3) the prose of formal documents, as in the\\nletter of artemidorus, ii, iii, 1-8.\\n\\n[footnote 1: professor j. churton collins\\'s _shakespeare as a prose\\nwriter_. see delius\\'s _die prosa in shakespeares dramen (shakespeare\\njahrbuch_, v, 227-273); janssen\\'s _die prosa in shakespeares dramen_;\\nprofessor hiram corson\\'s _an introduction to the study of shakespeare_,\\npp. 83-98.]\\n\\n\\nviii. the characters\\n\\njulius cæsar\\n\\nthe characterization of this drama in some of the parts is not a little\\nperplexing. hardly one of the speeches put into cæsar\\'s mouth can be\\nregarded as historically characteristic; taken all together, they seem\\nlittle short of a caricature. as here represented, cæsar appears little\\nbetter than a braggart; and when he speaks, it is in the style of a\\nglorious vapourer, full of lofty airs and mock thunder. nothing could\\nbe further from the truth of the man, whose character, even in his\\nfaults, was as compact and solid as adamant, and at the same time as\\nlimber and ductile as the finest gold. certain critics have seized and\\nworked upon this, as proving shakespeare\\'s lack of classical knowledge,\\nor carelessness in the use of his authorities. it proves neither the one\\nnor the other.\\n\\nit is true, cæsar\\'s ambition was gigantic, but none too much so for the\\nmind it dwelt in; for his character in all its features was gigantic.\\nand no man ever framed his ambition more in sympathy with the great\\nforces of nature, or built it upon a deeper foundation of political\\nwisdom and insight. now this \"last infirmity of noble minds\" is the only\\npart of him that the play really sets before us; and even this we do not\\nsee as it was, because it is here severed from the constitutional\\npeerage of his gifts and virtues; all those transcendent qualities which\\nplaced him at the summit of roman intellect and manhood being either\\nwithheld from the scene or thrown so far into the background that the\\nproper effect of them is lost.\\n\\nyet we have ample proof that shakespeare understood cæsar thoroughly,\\nand that he regarded him as \"the noblest man that ever lived in the tide\\nof times.\" for example, in _hamlet_, he makes horatio, who is one of his\\ncalmest and most right-thinking characters, speak of him as \"the\\nmightiest julius.\" in _antony and cleopatra_, again, the heroine is made\\nto describe him as \"broad-fronted cæsar\"; and in _king richard the\\nthird_ the young prince utters these lines:\\n\\n  that julius cæsar was a famous man:\\n  with what his valour did enrich his wit,\\n  his wit set down to make his valour live:\\n  death makes no conquest of this conqueror. [iii, i, 84-87.]\\n\\nin fact, we need not go beyond shakespeare to gather that julius cæsar\\'s\\nwas the deepest, the most versatile, and the most multitudinous head\\nthat ever figured in the political affairs of mankind.\\n\\nindeed, it is clear from this play itself that shakespeare did not\\nproceed at all from ignorance or misconception of the man. for it is\\nremarkable that, though cæsar delivers himself so out of character, yet\\nothers, both foes and friends, deliver him much nearer the truth; so\\nthat, while we see almost nothing of him directly, we nevertheless get,\\nupon the whole, a just reflection of him. especially in the marvelous\\nspeeches of antony and in the later events of the drama, both his inward\\ngreatness and his right of mastership over the roman world are fully\\nvindicated. for in the play as in the history, cæsar\\'s blood hastens and\\ncements the empire which the conspirators thought to prevent. they soon\\nfind that in the popular sympathies, and even in their own dumb\\nremorses, he has \"left behind powers that will work for him.\" he proves,\\nindeed, far mightier in death than in life; as if his spirit were become\\nat once the guardian angel of his cause and an avenging angel to his\\nfoes.\\n\\nand so it was in fact. nothing did so much to set the people in love\\nwith royalty, both name and thing, as the reflection that their beloved\\ncæsar, the greatest of their national heroes, the crown and consummation\\nof roman genius and character, had been murdered for aspiring to it.\\nthus their hereditary aversion to kingship was all subdued by the\\nremembrance of how and why their cæsar fell; and they who, before, would\\nhave plucked out his heart rather than he should wear a crown, would now\\nhave plucked out their own, to set a crown upon his head. such is the\\nnatural result, when the intensities of admiration and compassion meet\\ntogether in the human breast.\\n\\nfrom all which it may well be thought that cæsar was too great for the\\nhero of a drama, since his greatness, if brought forward in full\\nmeasure, would leave no room for anything else, at least would preclude\\nany proper dramatic balance and equipoise. it was only as a sort of\\nunderlying potency, or a force withdrawn into the background, that his\\npresence was compatible with that harmony and reciprocity of several\\ncharacters which a well-ordered drama requires. at all events, it is\\npretty clear that, where he was, such figures as brutus and cassius\\ncould never be very considerable, save as his assassins. they would not\\nhave been heard of in after times, if they had not \"struck the foremost\\nman of all this world\"; in other words, the great sun of rome had to be\\nshorn of his beams, else so ineffectual a fire as brutus could nowise\\ncatch the eye.\\n\\nbe this as it may, there is no doubt that shakespeare knew the whole\\nheight and compass of cæsar\\'s vast and varied capacity. it may be\\nregretted that he did not render him as he evidently saw him, inasmuch\\nas he alone, perhaps, of all the men who ever wrote could have given an\\nadequate expression of that colossal man.\\n\\nit is possible that the policy of the drama may have been to represent\\ncæsar not as he was indeed, but as he must have appeared to the\\nconspirators; to make us see him as they saw him, in order that they too\\nmight have fair and equal judgment at our hands. for cæsar was literally\\ntoo great to be seen by them, save as children often see bugbears by\\nmoonlight, when their inexperienced eyes are mocked with air. and\\nshakespeare may well have judged that the best way to set us right\\ntowards them was by identifying us more or less with them in mental\\nposition, and making us share somewhat in their delusion. for there is\\nscarce anything wherein we are so apt to err as in reference to the\\ncharacters of men, when time has settled and cleared up the questions in\\nwhich they lost their way: we blame them for not having seen as we see;\\nwhile in truth the things that are so bathed in light to us were full of\\ndarkness to them, and we should have understood them better, had we been\\nin the dark along with them.\\n\\ncæsar, indeed, was not bewildered by the political questions of his\\ntime; but all the rest were, and therefore he seemed so to them; and\\nwhile their own heads were swimming they naturally ascribed his seeming\\nbewilderment to a dangerous intoxication. as for his marvelous career of\\nsuccess, they attributed this mainly to his good luck, such being the\\ncommon refuge of inferior minds when they would escape the sense of\\ntheir inferiority. hence, as generally happens with the highest order of\\nmen, his greatness had to wait the approval of later events. he indeed,\\nfar beyond any other man of his age, \"looked into the seeds of time\";\\nbut this was not, and could not be known, till time had developed those\\nseeds into their fruits. why then may not shakespeare\\'s idea have been\\nso to order things that the full strength of the man should not appear\\nin the play, as it did not in fact, till after his fall? this view will\\nboth explain and justify the strange disguise--a sort of falsetto\\ngreatness--under which cæsar exhibits himself.\\n\\nnow the seeming contradiction between cæsar as known and cæsar as\\nrendered by shakespeare is what, more than anything else, perplexes.\\nbut a very refined, subtile, and peculiar irony pervades this, more than\\nany other of shakespeare\\'s plays; not intended as such, indeed, by the\\nspeakers, but a sort of historic irony,--the irony of providence, so to\\nspeak, or, if you please, of fate; much the same as is implied in the\\nproverb, \"a haughty spirit goeth before a fall.\" this irony crops out in\\nmany places. thus we have cæsar most blown with arrogance and godding it\\nin the loftiest style when the daggers of the assassins are on the very\\npoint of leaping at him. so too, all along, we find brutus most\\nconfident in those very things where he is most at fault, or acting like\\na man \"most ignorant of what he\\'s most assured\"; as when he says that\\n\"antony can do no more than cæsar\\'s arm when cæsar\\'s head is off.\" this,\\nto be sure, is not meant ironically by him, but it is turned into irony\\nby the fact that antony soon tears the cause of the conspirators all to\\npieces with his tongue. but, indeed, this sort of honest guile runs all\\nthrough the piece as a perfusive and permeating efficacy. a still better\\ninstance of it occurs just after the murder, when the chiefs of the\\nconspiracy are exulting in the transcendent virtue and beneficence of\\ntheir deed, and in its future stage celebrity; and cassius says,--\\n\\n  so often shall the knot of us be call\\'d\\n  the men that gave their country liberty. [iii, i, 118-119.]\\n\\nand again, a little later, when brutus says of antony, \"i know that we\\nshall have him well to friend.\" not indeed that the men themselves\\nthought any irony in those speeches: it was natural, no doubt, that they\\nshould utter such things in all seriousness; but what they say is\\ninterpreted into irony by the subsequent events. and when such a\\nshallow idealist as brutus is made to overtop and outshine the greatest\\npractical genius the world ever saw, what is it but a refined and\\nsubtile irony at work on a much larger scale, and diffusing itself,\\nsecretly, it may be, but not the less vitally, into the texture? it was\\nnot the frog that thought irony, when he tried to make himself as big as\\nthe ox; but there was a pretty decided spice of irony in the mind that\\nconceived the fable.\\n\\nit is to be noted further that brutus uniformly speaks of cæsar with\\nrespect, almost indeed with admiration. it is his ambition, not his\\ngreatness, that brutus resents; the thought that his own consequence is\\nimpaired by cæsar\\'s elevation having no influence with him. with\\ncassius, on the contrary, impatience of his superiority is the ruling\\nmotive: he is all the while thinking of the disparagement he suffers by\\ncæsar\\'s exaltation.\\n\\n                            this man\\n  is now become a god, and cassius is\\n  a wretched creature, and must bend his body\\n  if cæsar carelessly but nod on him. [i, ii, 115-118.]\\n\\n  why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\\n  like a colossus, and we petty men\\n  walk under his huge legs. [i, ii, 135-137.]\\n\\nthus he overflows with mocking comparisons, and finds his pastime in\\nflouting at cæsar as having managed by a sham heroism to hoodwink the\\nworld.\\n\\nand yet shakespeare makes cæsar characterize himself very much as\\ncassius, in his splenetic temper, describes him. cæsar gods it in his\\ntalk, as if on purpose to approve the style in which cassius mockingly\\ngods him. this, taken by itself, would look as if the dramatist sided\\nwith cassius; yet one can hardly help feeling that he sympathized rather\\nin antony\\'s great oration. and the sequel, as we have seen, justifies\\nantony\\'s opinion of cæsar. the subsequent course of things has the\\neffect of inverting the mockery of cassius against himself.\\n\\nthe final issue of the conspiracy, as represented by shakespeare, is a\\npretty conclusive argument of the blunder, not to say the crime, of its\\nauthors. cæsar, dead, tears them and their cause all to pieces. in\\neffect, they did but stab him into a mightier life; so that brutus might\\nwell say, as indeed he does at last,--\\n\\n  o julius cæsar, thou art mighty yet!\\n  thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords\\n  in our own proper entrails. [v, iii, 94-96.]\\n\\nthe nemesis which asserts itself so sternly in the latter part of the\\nplay may be regarded as a reflex of irony on some of the earlier scenes.\\nthis view infers the disguise of cæsar to be an instance of the profound\\nguile with which shakespeare sometimes plays upon his characters,\\nhumoring their bent, and then leaving them to the discipline of events.\\n\\n\\nbrutus\\n\\ncoleridge has a shrewd doubt as to what sort of a character shakespeare\\nmeant his brutus to be. for, in his thinking aloud just after the\\nbreaking of the conspiracy to him, brutus avowedly grounds his purpose,\\nnot on anything cæsar has done, nor on what he is, but simply on what he\\n_may become_ when crowned. he \"knows no personal cause to spurn at him\";\\nnor has he \"known when his affections sway\\'d more than his reason\"; but\\n\"he would be crown\\'d: how that might change his nature, there\\'s the\\nquestion\"; and,\\n\\n                         since the quarrel\\n  will bear no colour for the thing he is,\\n  fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,\\n  would run to these and these extremities;\\n  and therefore think him as a serpent\\'s egg\\n  which, hatch\\'d, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,\\n  and kill him in the shell. [ii, i, 28-34.]\\n\\nso then brutus heads a plot to assassinate the man who, besides being\\nclothed with the sanctions of law as the highest representative of the\\nstate, has been his personal friend and benefactor; all this, too, not\\non any ground of fact, but on an assumed probability that the crown will\\nprove a sacrament of evil, and transform him into quite another man. a\\nstrange piece of casuistry indeed! but nowise unsuited to the spirit of\\na man who was to commit the gravest of crimes, purely from a misplaced\\nvirtue.\\n\\nand yet the character of brutus is full of beauty and sweetness. in all\\nthe relations of life he is upright, gentle, and pure; of a\\nsensitiveness and delicacy of principle that cannot bosom the slightest\\nstain; his mind enriched and fortified with the best extractions of\\nphilosophy; a man adorned with all the virtues which, in public and\\nprivate, at home and in the circle of friends, win respect and charm the\\nheart.\\n\\nbeing such a man, of course he could only do what he did under some sort\\nof delusion. and so indeed it is. yet this very delusion serves,\\napparently, to ennoble and beautify him, as it takes him and works upon\\nhim through his virtues. at heart he is a real patriot, every inch of\\nhim. but his patriotism, besides being somewhat hidebound with\\npatrician pride, is of the speculative kind, and dwells, where his whole\\ncharacter has been chiefly formed, in a world of poetical and\\nphilosophic ideals. he is an enthusiastic student of books. plato is his\\nfavorite teacher; and he has studiously framed his life and tuned his\\nthoughts to the grand and pure conceptions won from that all but divine\\nsource: plato\\'s genius walks with him in the senate, sits with him at\\nthe fireside, goes with him to the wars, and still hovers about his\\ntent.\\n\\nhis great fault, then, lies in supposing it his duty to be meddling with\\nthings that he does not understand. conscious of high thoughts and just\\ndesires, but with no gift of practical insight, he is ill fitted to\\n\"grind among the iron facts of life.\" in truth, he does not really see\\nwhere he is; the actual circumstances and tendencies amidst which he\\nlives are as a book written in a language he cannot read. the characters\\nof those who act with him are too far below the region of his principles\\nand habitual thinkings for him to take the true cast of them. himself\\nincapable of such motives as govern them, he just projects and suspends\\nhis ideals in them, and then misreckons upon them as realizing the men\\nof his own brain. so also he clings to the idea of the great and free\\nrepublic of his fathers, the old rome that has ever stood to his\\nfeelings touched with the consecrations of time and glorified with the\\nhigh virtues that have grown up under her cherishing. but, in the long\\nreign of tearing faction and civil butchery, that which he worships has\\nbeen substantially changed, the reality lost. cæsar, already clothed\\nwith the title and the power of imperator for life, would change the\\nform so as to agree with the substance, the name so as to fit the thing.\\nbut brutus is so filled with the idea of that which has thus passed\\naway never to return that he thinks to save or recover the whole by\\npreventing such formal and nominal change.\\n\\nand so his whole course is that of one acting on his own ideas, not on\\nthe facts that are before and around him. indeed, he does not _see_\\nthem; he merely dreams his own meaning into them. he is swift to do that\\nby which he thinks his country _ought to be benefited_. as the killing\\nof cæsar stands in his purpose, he and his associates are to be\\n\"sacrificers, not butchers.\" but that the deed may have the effect he\\nhopes for, his countrymen generally must regard it in the same light as\\nhe does. that they will do this is the very thing which he has _in fact_\\nno reason to conclude; notwithstanding, because it is so _in his idea_,\\ntherefore he trusts that the conspirators will \"be called purgers, not\\nmurderers.\" meanwhile, the plain truth is, that if his countrymen had\\nbeen capable of regarding the deed as a sacrifice, they would not have\\nmade nor permitted any occasion for it. it is certain that, unless so\\nconstrued, the act must prove fruitful of evil; all rome is full of\\nthings proving that it cannot be so construed; but this is what brutus\\nhas no eye to see.\\n\\nso too, in his oration \"to show the _reason_ of our cæsar\\'s death,\" he\\nspeaks, in calm and dispassionate manner, just those things which he\\nthinks ought to set the people right and himself right in their eyes,\\nforgetting all the while that the deed cannot fail to make the people\\nmad, and that popular madness is not a thing to be reasoned with. and\\nfor the same cause he insists on sparing antony, and on permitting him\\nto speak in cæsar\\'s funeral. to do otherwise would be unjust, and so\\nwould overthrow the whole nature of the enterprise as it lives in his\\nmind. and because in his idea it ought so to be, he trusts that antony\\nwill make cæsar\\'s death the occasion of strengthening those who killed\\nhim, not perceiving the strong likelihood, which soon passes into a\\nfact, that in cutting off cæsar they have taken away the only check on\\nantony\\'s ambition. he ought to have foreseen that antony, instead of\\nbeing drawn to their side, would rather make love to cæsar\\'s place at\\ntheir expense.\\n\\nthus the course of brutus serves no end but to set on foot another civil\\nwar, which naturally hastens and assures the very thing he sought to\\nprevent. he confides in the goodness of his cause, not considering that\\nthe better the cause, the worse its chance with bad men. he thinks it\\nsafe to trust others because he knows they can safely trust him; the\\nsingleness of his own eye causing him to believe that others will see as\\nhe sees, the purity of his own heart, that others will feel as he feels.\\n\\nhere then we have a strong instance of a very good man doing a very bad\\nthing; and, withal, of a wise man acting most unwisely because his\\nwisdom knew not its place; a right noble, just, heroic spirit bearing\\ndirectly athwart the virtues he worships. on the whole, it is not\\nwonderful that brutus should have exclaimed, as he is said to have done,\\nthat he had worshiped virtue and found her at last but a shade. so\\nworshiped, she may well prove a shade indeed! admiration of the man\\'s\\ncharacter, reprobation of his proceedings,--which of these is the\\nstronger with us? and there is much the same irony in the representation\\nof brutus as in that of cæsar; only the order of it is here reversed. as\\nif one should say, \"o yes, yes! in the practical affairs of mankind your\\ncharming wisdom of the closet will doubtless put to shame the workings\\nof mere practical insight and sagacity.\"\\n\\nshakespeare\\'s exactness in the minutest details of character is well\\nshown in the speech already referred to; which is the utterance of a man\\nphilosophizing most unphilosophically; as if the academy should betake\\nitself to the stump, and this too without any sense of the incongruity.\\nplutarch has a short passage which served as a hint, not indeed for the\\nmatter, but for the style of that speech. \"they do note,\" says he, \"in\\nsome of his epistles that he counterfeited that brief compendious manner\\nof speech of the lacedæmonians. as, when the war was begun, he wrote\\nunto the pergamenians in this sort: \\'i understand you have given\\ndolabella money: if you have done it willingly, you confess you have\\noffended me; if against your wills, show it then by giving me\\nwillingly.\\'... these were brutus\\' manner of letters, which were honoured\\nfor their briefness.\" the speech in question is far enough indeed from\\nbeing a model of style either for oratory or anything else, but it is\\nfinely characteristic; while its studied primness and epigrammatic\\nfinish contrast most unfavorably with the frank-hearted yet artful\\neloquence of antony.\\n\\nand what a rare significance attaches to the brief scene of brutus and\\nhis drowsy boy lucius in camp a little before the catastrophe! there, in\\nthe deep of the night, long after all the rest have lost themselves in\\nsleep, and when the anxieties of the issue are crowding upon him,--there\\nwe have the earnest, thoughtful brutus hungering intensely for the\\nrepasts of treasured thought.\\n\\n  look, lucius, here\\'s the book i sought for so;\\n  i put it in the pocket of my gown. [iv, iii, 252, 253.]\\n\\nwhat the man is, and where he ought to be, is all signified in these two\\nlines. and do we not taste a dash of benignant irony in the implied\\nrepugnance between the spirit of the man and the stuff of his present\\nundertaking? the idea of a bookworm riding the whirlwind of war! the\\nthing is most like brutus; but how out of his element, how unsphered\\nfrom his right place, it shows him! there is a touch of drollery in the\\ncontrast, which the richest steeping of poetry does not disguise. and\\nthe irony is all the more delectable for being so remote and\\nunpronounced; like one of those choice arrangements in the background of\\na painting, which, without attracting conscious notice, give a zest and\\nrelish to what stands in front. the scene, whether for charm of\\nsentiment or felicity of conception, is one of the finest in\\nshakespeare.\\n\\n\\nbrutus and cassius\\n\\nthe characters of brutus and cassius are nicely discriminated, scarce a\\nword falling from either but what smacks of the man. cassius is much the\\nbetter conspirator, but much the worse man; and the better in that\\nbecause the worse in this. for brutus engages in the conspiracy on\\ngrounds of abstract and ideal justice; while cassius holds it both a\\nwrong and a blunder to go about such a thing without making success his\\nfirst care. this, accordingly, is what he works for, being reckless of\\nall other considerations in his choice and use of means. withal he is\\nmore impulsive and quick than brutus, because less under the\\nself-discipline of moral principle. his motives, too, are of a much more\\nmixed and various quality, because his habits of thinking and acting\\nhave grown by the measures of experience; he studies to understand men\\nas they are; brutus, as he thinks they ought to be. hence, in every case\\nwhere brutus crosses him, brutus is wrong, and he is right,--right, that\\nis, if success be their aim. cassius judges, and surely rightly, that\\nthe end should give law to the means; and that \"the honorable men whose\\ndaggers have stabb\\'d cæsar\" should not be hampered much with\\nconscientious scruples.\\n\\nstill brutus overawes him by his moral energy and elevation of\\ncharacter, and by the open-faced rectitude and purity of his principles.\\nbrutus has no thoughts or aims that he is afraid or ashamed to avow;\\ncassius has many which he would fain hide even from himself. and he\\ncatches a sort of inspiration and is raised above himself by contact\\nwith brutus. and cassius, moreover, acts very much from personal hatred\\nof cæsar, as remembering how, not long before, he and brutus had stood\\nfor the chief prætorship of the city, and brutus through cæsar\\'s favor\\nhad got the election. and so shakespeare read in plutarch that \"cassius,\\nbeing a choleric man, and hating cæsar privately more than he did the\\ntyranny openly, incensed brutus against him.\" the effect of this is\\nfinely worked out by the dramatist in the man\\'s affected scorn of cæsar,\\nand in the scoffing humor in which he loves to speak of him. for such is\\nthe natural language of a masked revenge.\\n\\nthe tone of cassius is further indicated, and with exquisite art, in his\\nsoliloquy where, after tempering brutus to his purpose, and finding how\\nhis \"honorable metal may be wrought,\" he gently slurs him for being\\npracticable to flatteries, and then proceeds to ruminate the scheme for\\nworking upon his vanity, and thereby drawing him into the conspiracy;\\nthus spilling the significant fact, that his own honor does not stick\\nto practice the arts by which he thinks it is a shame to be seduced.\\n\\nit is a noteworthy point also that cassius is too practical and too much\\nof a politician to see any ghosts. acting on far lower principles than\\nhis leader, and such as that leader would spurn as both wicked and base,\\nhe therefore does no violence to his heart in screwing it to the work he\\ntakes in hand; his heart is even more at home in the work than his head;\\nwhereas brutus, from the wrenching his heart has suffered, keeps\\nreverting to the moral complexion of his first step. the remembrance of\\nthis is a thorn in his side; while cassius has no sensibilities of\\nnature for such compunctions to stick upon. brutus is never thoroughly\\nhimself after the assassination; that his heart is ill at ease is shown\\nin a certain dogged tenacity of honor and overstraining of rectitude, as\\nif he were struggling to make atonement with his conscience. the stab he\\ngave cæsar planted in his own upright and gentle nature a germ of\\nremorse, which, gathering strength from every subsequent adversity, came\\nto embody itself in imaginary sights and sounds; the spirit of justice,\\nmade an ill angel to him by his own sense of wrong, hovering in the\\nbackground of his after life, and haunting his solitary moments in the\\nshape of cæsar\\'s ghost. and so it is well done, that he is made to see\\nthe \"monstrous apparition\" just after his heart has been pierced through\\nwith many sorrows at hearing of portia\\'s shocking death.\\n\\n\\nportia\\n\\nthe delineation of portia is completed in a few brief masterly strokes.\\nonce seen, the portrait ever after lives an old and dear acquaintance of\\nthe reader\\'s inner man. portia has strength enough to do and suffer for\\nothers, but very little for herself. as the daughter of cato and the\\nwife of brutus, she has set in her eye a pattern of how she ought to\\nthink and act, being \"so father\\'d and so husbanded\"; but still her head\\nfloats merged over the ears in her heart; and it is only when affection\\nspeaks that her spirit is hushed into the listening which she would fain\\nyield only to the speech of reason. she has a clear idea of the stoical\\ncalmness and fortitude which appears so noble and so graceful in her\\nbrutus; it all lies faithfully reproduced in her mind; she knows well\\nhow to honor and admire it; yet she cannot work it into the texture of\\nher character; she can talk it like a book, but she tries in vain to\\nlive it.\\n\\nplutarch gives one most touching incident respecting her which\\nshakespeare did not use, though he transfused the sense of it into his\\nwork. it occurred some time after cæsar\\'s death, and when the civil war\\nwas growing to a head: \"brutus, seeing the state of rome would be\\nutterly overthrown, went ... unto the city of elea standing by the sea.\\nthere portia, being ready to depart from her husband brutus and to\\nreturn to rome, did what she could to dissemble the grief and sorrow she\\nfelt at her heart. but a certain painted table (picture) bewrayed her in\\nthe end.... the device was taken out of the greek stories, how\\nandromache accompanied her husband hector when he went out of the city\\nof troy to go to the wars, and how hector delivered her his little son,\\nand how her eyes were never off him. portia, seeing this picture, and\\nlikening herself to be in the same case, she fell a-weeping; and coming\\nthither oftentimes in a day to see it, she wept still.\" the force of\\nthis incident is reproduced in the portia of the play; we have its full\\neffect in the matter about her self-inflicted wound as compared with her\\nsubsequent demeanor.\\n\\nportia gives herself that gash without flinching, and bears it without a\\nmurmur, as an exercise and proof of fortitude; and she translates her\\npains into smiles, all to comfort and support her husband. so long as\\nthis purpose lends her strength, she is fully equal to her thought,\\nbecause here her heart keeps touch perfectly with her head. but, this\\nmotive gone, the weakness, if it be not rather the strength, of her\\nwoman\\'s nature rushes full upon her; her feelings rise into an\\nuncontrollable flutter, and run out at every joint and motion of her\\nbody; and nothing can arrest the inward mutiny till affection again\\nwhispers her into composure, lest she say something that may hurt or\\nendanger her brutus.\\n\\n\\nantony\\n\\nshakespeare\\'s completed characterization of antony is in _antony and\\ncleopatra_. in the later play antony is delineated with his native\\naptitudes for vice warmed into full development by the great egyptian\\nsorceress. in _julius cæsar_ shakespeare emphasizes as one of antony\\'s\\ncharacteristic traits his unreserved adulation of cæsar, shown in\\nreckless purveying to his dangerous weakness,--the desire to be called a\\nking. already cæsar had more than kingly power, and it was the obvious\\npart of a friend to warn him against this ambition. here and there are\\napt indications of his proneness to those vicious levities and debasing\\nluxuries which afterwards ripened into such a gigantic profligacy. he\\nhas not yet attained to that rank and full-blown combination of cruelty,\\nperfidy, and voluptuousness, which the world associates with his name,\\nbut he is plainly on the way to it. his profound and wily\\ndissimulation, while knitting up the hollow truce with the assassins on\\nthe very spot where \"great cæsar fell,\" is managed with admirable skill;\\nhis deep spasms of grief being worked out in just the right way to\\nquench their suspicions, and make them run into the toils, when he calls\\non them to render him their bloody hands. nor have they any right to\\ncomplain, for he is but paying them in their own coin; and we think none\\nthe worse of him that he fairly outdoes them at their own practice.\\n\\nbut antony\\'s worst parts as here delivered are his exultant treachery in\\nproposing to use his colleague lepidus as at once the pack-horse and the\\nscape-goat of the triumvirate, and his remorseless savagery in arranging\\nfor the slaughter of all that was most illustrious in rome, bartering\\naway his own uncle, to glut his revenge with the blood of cicero; though\\neven here his revenge was less hideous than the cold-blooded policy of\\nyoung octavius. yet antony has in the play, as he had in fact, some\\nright noble streaks in him; for his character was a very mixed one; and\\nthere was to the last a fierce war of good and evil within him.\\nespecially he had an eye to see, a heart to feel, and a soul to honor\\nthe superb structure of manhood which rome possessed in julius cæsar,\\nwho stood to him, indeed, as a kind of superior nature, to raise him\\nabove himself. he \"fear\\'d cæsar, honour\\'d him, and lov\\'d him\"; and with\\nthe murdered cæsar for his theme, he was for once inspired and kindled\\nto a rapture of the truest, noblest, most overwhelming eloquence.\\nnoteworthy also is the grateful remembrance at last of his obligations\\nto brutus for having saved him from the daggers of the conspirators.\\n\\n\\nthe people\\n\\nthat many-headed, but withal big-souled creature, the multitude, is\\ncharmingly characterized in _julius cæsar_. the common people, it is\\ntrue, are rather easily swayed hither and thither by the contagion of\\nsympathy and of persuasive speech; yet their feelings are in the main\\nright, and even their judgment in the long run is better than that of\\nthe pampered roman aristocracy, inasmuch as it proceeds more from the\\ninstincts of manhood. shakespeare evidently loved to play with the\\nnatural, unsophisticated, though somewhat childish heart of the people;\\nbut his playing is always genial and human-hearted, with a certain\\nangelic humor in it that seldom fails to warm us towards the subject. on\\nthe whole, he understood the people well, and they have well repaid him\\nin understanding him better than the critics have often done. the\\ncobbler\\'s droll humor, at the opening of this play, followed as it is by\\na strain of the loftiest poetry, is aptly noted by campbell as showing\\nthat the dramatist, \"even in dealing with classical subjects, laughed at\\nthe classic fear of putting the ludicrous and sublime into\\njuxtaposition.\"\\n\\n\\nix. general characteristics\\n\\nas a whole, _julius cæsar_ is inferior to _coriolanus_, but it abounds\\nin scenes and passages fraught, with the highest virtue of shakespeare\\'s\\ngenius. among these may be specially mentioned the second scene of the\\nfirst act, where cassius sows the seed of the conspiracy in brutus\\'s\\nmind, warmed with such a wrappage of instigation as to assure its\\neffective germination; also the first scene of the second act,\\nunfolding the birth of the conspiracy, and winding up with the\\ninterview, so charged with domestic glory, of brutus and portia. the\\noration of antony in cæsar\\'s funeral is such an interfusion of art and\\npassion as realizes the very perfection of its kind. adapted at once to\\nthe comprehension of the lowest mind and to the delectation of the\\nhighest, and running its pathos into the very quick of them that hear\\nit, it tells with terrible effect on the people; and when it is done we\\nfeel that cæsar\\'s bleeding wounds are mightier than ever his genius and\\nfortune were. the quarrel of brutus and cassius is deservedly\\ncelebrated. dr. johnson thought it \"somewhat cold and unaffecting.\"\\ncoleridge thought otherwise. see note, p. 123. but there is nothing in\\nthe play that is more divinely touched than the brief scene, already\\nnoticed, of brutus and his boy lucius--so gentle, so dutiful, so loving,\\nso thoughtful and careful for his master, and yet himself no more\\nconscious of his virtue than a flower of its fragrance. there is no more\\nexquisite passage in all shakespeare than that which tells of the boy\\'s\\nfalling asleep in the midst of his song and exclaiming on being aroused,\\n\"the strings, my lord, are
